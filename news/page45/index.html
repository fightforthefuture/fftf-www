        <span class="date">Posted 10:31 EDT on May 22, 2014</span>


        <p id="docs-internal-guid-d9816410-2455-a6f8-35d9-82927d2532b6"><span>Yesterday, Congress sold you out.</span><span> House leadership watered down their version of the USA Freedom Act with an amendment that creates vast new loopholes for the NSA. The new version will allow most bulk government surveillance to continue &ndash; and it might even make it worse [1].</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">We can’t trust the government to solve this problem. But we knew that already, so we have a plan. It’s time to Reset the Net.</a></strong></p>
<p><span><img src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n5zcegiMwm1ri3xd7.png"/></span></p>

<p><span>The crazy thing is, the USA Freedom Act was already just a baby step in the right direction.</span><span> Fight for the Future hesitated to throw our full support behind it because we felt it didn’t go nearly far enough to reign in the NSA, and left activists, journalists, and people outside the U.S. vulnerable. </span></p>
<p><span>This new, weakened version of the bill is an insult to the millions of people worldwide who have spoken out calling for an end to abusive government spying.</span><span> And so-called privacy champions in Congress are saying this is the best “we’re going to get.” [2]</span></p>
<p><span>I mean, we’re not surprised, but think about that: after the most lurid and earth-shattering leaks in the history of the NSA, this is the best Congress can do. Seriously?</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">If this is the best they can do, we need to take matters into our own hands. Let’s do everything in our power to make spying harder. It’s time to take our privacy back.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>This just goes to show that, when you settle for a mediocre reform bill, you’ll get an even worse one. </span><span>We need to push onward and continue to grow the movement against mass surveillance until we can’t be ignored. </span></p>
<p><span>On June 5th, the anniversary of the first NSA story leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, thousands of people, companies, and tons of your favorite websites, will harness their collective power to strengthen the security of the web through technology and mass action. Together, we’ll encourage mass adoption of easy-to-use encryption tools that directly interfere in dragnet surveillance, and tech companies and websites will announce a cascade of security improvements that protect users’ basic rights and make mass surveillance much harder.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">Everyone has a role to play. Click here to help Reset the Net.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Today everyone should be feeling outrage that those in power in Washington, DC continue to ignore the overwhelming public cry for an end to mass surveillance. But we need to channel that outrage into action that will really work. </span></p>
<p><span>See you on June 5th when we Reset the Net. </span></p>
<p><span>Onward,</span></p>
<p><span>-Evan, Tiffiniy, and Holmes<br/>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. Many of you have been asking us what comes next in the fight for net neutrality after our </span><strong><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank">successful encampment outside the FCC.</a></strong><span> We’re planning the next moves, so stay tuned! And if you want to send a message to the FCC right now, </span><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/tellfcc" target="_blank"><span></span><strong>you can do it here</strong></a><span>.</span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 13:57 EDT on May 14, 2014</span>


        <p><span>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>May 14, 2014</span></p>
<p><span>MEDIA CONTACTS:<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org<br/>Margaret Flowers - 410-591-0892<br/>Kevin Zeese: 301-996-6582<br/>Kevin Huang: 510-648-5048<br/>Evan Greer: 978-852-6457</span></p>
<p><span><strong>FCC Chair Tom Wheeler comes out of FCC building to meet with net neutrality protesters who have been camped out on his doorstep since May 7th. Events planned tomorrow in more than 20 cities.</strong> </span></p>
<p><em>Activists from Popular Resistance and Fight for the Future tell the Chairman that the only path toward lasting net neutrality is reclassifying the Internet as a common carrier to protect it in the public interest</em></p>
<p><em><img alt="image" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n5ksmph4sE1ri3xd7.jpg"/></em></p>
<p><span><strong>WASHINGTON, DC</strong> &ndash; This morning at 10:00am net neutrality protesters saw further evidence of the impact of grassroots organizing as FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler came out to meet with the <a href="http://fight4future.tumblr.com/post/85622318333/press-release-net-neutrality-activists-occupy-the" target="_blank">Occupy the FCC encampment </a>which has surrounded the FCC headquarters in Washington, DC with tents, protest signs, and banners since May 7th.</span></p>
<p><span>He was followed later by Commissioner Mignon Clyburn. This means a majority of the five commissioners have visited the encampment to talk with protesters.  On Friday, Ajit Pai meet with the protesters.</span></p>
<p><span>Activists from Occupy the FCC say they are glad that the FCC has been responding to public pressure, but won’t be satisfied until the agency takes meaningful action. The encampment will continue until after the FCC proposal is announced tomorrow. A variety of organizations have called for simultaneous gatherings at FCC buildings in more than 20 U.S. cities tomorrow, May 15th at 12:00noon.  After tomorrow, the groups pledge to escalate their organizing to mobilize people to shape the future of the Internet as an open, democratic tool with equal access to all &ndash; real net neutrality.</span></p>
<p><strong>Below are quotes from organizers of Occupy the FCC in response to Tom Wheeler’s remarks at the camp. Please contact us if you’d like to schedule an interview with one of the activists who spoke with the Chairman.</strong></p>
<p><span>“It is great that Wheeler came to the encampment to talk with us but he is still in favor of a solution that will not work,” </span><strong>said Kevin Zeese of PopularResistance.org, who has been camped out at the FCC since May 7th.</strong><span> “Section 706 does not give the FCC the authority it needs to ensure real Net Neutrality protections. This approach has lost in court twice. The only reason he will not take the approach necessary, reclassifying the Internet as a common carrier, is because the mega-telecom companies &ndash; whom he used to work for &ndash; do not want it.”</span></p>
<p><span>“We want the Chairman to understand that we won&rsquo;t settle for anything less than making the last mile of the Internet net neutral,” </span><strong>said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of FIght for the Future.</strong><span> “Chairman Wheeler, saying that you promise to keep pre-peer  ‘open,’ meaning according to your rules that there will be fast and slow lanes, is obviously not enough. The only way to ensure that we have a net neutral Internet is to reclassify under Title II.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Wheeler came to the encampment because public pressure is mounting,”</span><strong> added Margaret Flowers also of PopularResistance.org</strong><span><strong>,</strong> “We have gotten strong media coverage, not only in the online community, but in Time Magazine, the Washington Post and other corporate media outlets. He has backtracked from his initial proposal &ndash; that would have ended net neutrality and set up a tiered Internet based on fees &ndash; because of public pressure. He has received more than a million emails favoring net neutrality as well as thousands of phone calls while our encampment has been growing on his doorstep. It is going to take escalating public pressure to respond to the telecom giants who will be fighting the public interest every step of the way.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Kevin Huang of Fight for the Future, who was also at the encampment when Wheeler visited, said,</strong><span> “Wheeler is speeding towards the quickest solution by proposing rules instead of structural change through reclassification. His plan is a bandaid that can easily be peeled off  by the courts or the next chair. The people want the Internet to be returned to its original status as a common carrier so that the FCC has real power to represent the public&rsquo;s interest against telecom giants and the public has a mechanism for accountability.”</span></p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n5kyp9tseW1ri3xd7.jpg"/></p>

<p><br/><span>“Wheeler was forced to come to the camp at Occupy the FCC because it is growing and the majority of the public, FCC employees, tech companies and media are united in their support for returning the Internet to common carrier status,” </span><strong>Margaret Flowers concluded. </strong><span>“Now what we need is action, not photo ops. Let’s open this debate up to the people in a public forum. We say “no” to backroom deals with industry giants.”</span></p>

<p><strong>“Occupy the FCC” encampment gathers support from tech companies and advocacy groups as net neutrality protesters surround FCC headquarters with tents and banners</strong></p>
<p><em>Unsatisfied with backpedaling and empty promises from FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, activists are camped out day and night on the agency’s doorstep demanding the Internet be reclassified as a common carrier</em></p>
<p><span>WASHINGTON, DC &ndash; This morning, and every morning since last Wednesday, FCC employees were greeted on their way in to work by a dedicated group of net neutrality activists who are camped out on the agency’s doorstep with tents, signs, and a giant banner reading, “Don’t Break the Internet!” Many FCC employees have expressed their support to the demonstrators, who have distributed hundreds of flyers to people entering FCC headquarters.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://time.com/96688/net-neutrality-plan-in-chaos/" target="_blank"><span>TIME Magazine reports</span></a><span>: &ldquo;The FCC’s eighth floor executive office has been thrown into chaos amid a mounting backlash that shut down its phone lines as a growing number of Open Internet advocates camp out in front of their office.&rdquo; </span><span></span></p>

<p><span>The encampment was sparked last week by activists from Fight for the Future and PopularResistance.org and is growing steadily, gaining support today from major tech companies including CREDO Mobile and reddit as well as advocacy groups Demand Progress, MoveOn.org, OpenMedia, and Free Press. </span></p>
<p><span>Organizers at Occupy the FCC promise escalation of their protests and have several events planned this week including a concert and open mic Tuesday night and an art-making party on Wednesday night. The week-long protest will culminate during </span><strong><a href="http://act.freepress.net/survey/DC_May_15/" target="_blank">a rally</a></strong><span> on May 15th organized by a diverse range of organizations. The protest comes after a month of intense online action during which millions of people emailed, called, or signed petitions to the FCC demanding that protect net neutrality.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re here at the FCC night and day because the future of the Internet is being decided in this building &ndash; and the open web is too important to our democracy for us to remain silent,” </span><strong>said Kevin Huang of Fight for the Future</strong><span>, “We won’t be fooled by Tom Wheeler’s empty promises. There is only one clear path forward for for real net neutrality: the FCC must reclassify the Internet as a common carrier under Title II of the Communications Act. Anything less is just ‘net neutrality’ in air quotes.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Camping out here on FCC’s doorstep, it is so clear that the influence that corporate lobbyists have had over this building is starting to crumble,” </span><span>s<strong>aid Margaret Flowers of PopularResistance.org</strong></span><strong>, who has been camped out at the FCC since May 7th. </strong><span>“We have had many FCC employees stop by our camp to express their support, and more people and tents are showing up every day from all over the country. If Tom Wheeler sticks with his buddies at AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast, he will soon find out that they are the only friends he has. If Wheeler is unable to put the public interest before his colleagues in industry maybe it is time for Wheeler to resign.”</span></p>
<p><span>“The public outcry over Tom Wheeler’s proposal to allow for discrimination on the Internet has become impossible to ignore” </span><strong>said Becky Bond, Political Director of CREDO Mobile, </strong><span>“More and more, people depend on the Internet to meet their basic needs. The FCC needs to treat the web as what it is: a public utility that should be protected in the public interest.”<br/>Here are some photos of the encampment. <a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank">Click here for more.</a><br/></span></p>
