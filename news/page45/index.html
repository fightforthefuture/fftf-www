      <h1><a href="/news/2014-12-17-fcc-and-sunlight-foundation-drastically/">FCC and Sunlight Foundation drastically undercounted pro-net neutrality comments and should immediately correct the record</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 13:14 EST on December 17, 2014</span>


        <p><span><em><strong>Breaking Update:</strong> the FCC has now acknowledged to Fight for the Future in an email that there is a discrepancy in their data and they dropped at least 244,881 pro-net neutrality comments:<strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/545318660387377152" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/545318660387377152</a></strong></em><br/></span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>Update 2:</strong> Sunlight <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/12/17/clearing-up-the-confusion-about-our-analysis-of-net-neutrality-comments-to-the-fcc/" target="_blank"><u>has responded</u></a>. To read our analysis of their response and our rebuttal to the Sunlight Foundation&rsquo;s report, click here: <b><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/105475259503/why-is-sunlight-foundation-playing-into-american" target="_blank">http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/105475259503/why-is-sunlight-foundation-playing-into-american</a></b></em><br/><br/>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>December 17, 2014</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Media Contact:<br/>Evan Greer, Fight for the Future</span><span><br/></span><span>Phone: 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</span></p>
<p><span>WASHINGTON, DC &ndash;Several media outlets have run headlines based on a study from the Sunlight Foundation that is based on faulty data, which drastically underrepresents the number of pro-net neutrality comments the FCC received during its second comment period. </span></p>
<p><span>Based on a combination of errors by Sunlight and the FCC, it appears that Sunlight&rsquo;s report undercounts the number of comments submitted through Battle for the Net (a collaboration of Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, and Free Press) by at least 500,000. This alone undermines Sunlight’s claim that anti-net neutrality comments dominated the reply-comment period, but there are likely additional errors as well.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Based on an initial look at the data by Fight for the Future’s technologists, it appears that there are two major issues:</strong> </span></p>
<ol><li>
<p><span>T<strong>he FCC failed to register a significant number of pro-net neutrality comments that were sent.</strong> We’ve thus far identified at least 150,798 comments that were missing from the FCC&rsquo;s data dump, and ongoing analysis of their data suggests that this number is in fact much higher. </span><strong>This alone is enough to completely unseat the conclusion that anti-net neutrality commenters “dominated” the second comment period.<br/><br/></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>The Sunlight Foundation’s analysis used a flawed data set that it misleadingly characterized as representative of the full set of comments; it ignored one third of the release of the FCC data (by Sunlight’s own admission), close to 800,000 comments, because of difficulty processing those comments.</strong> The data Sunlight used cannot be assumed to be &ldquo;reasonably representative&rdquo; of all the comments. There were several methods by which comments could be submitted to the FCC. Because this led to inconsistencies in the FCC’s release of the data, it&rsquo;s an error for Sunlight to infer that the excluded comments maintained the same distribution of pro- vs. anti-net neutrality submissions as the data Sunlight did consider.  In particular, while pro-net neutrality comments were vastly undercounted by Sunlight, it appears that approximately all of American Commitment’s comments were counted: The organization claims to have generated 800,000 comments, and Sunlight claims to have counted 800,000 comments from them. <strong>The result is that the Sunlight Foundation’s finding that anti-net neutrality groups “dominated” the second round comment period is completely unfounded.</strong></span></p>
</li>
</ol><p><span><strong>Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng said,</strong> </span><span>“Millions of people have spoken out in support of net neutrality, and their voices matter. Getting these numbers right is important. The FCC and the Sunlight Foundation need to act immediately to correct the record, and media outlets that have ran stories based on the faulty data should publish prominent corrections.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Sunlight applied a flawed sampling methodology to a flawed set of data, and drew conclusions that are impossible to make with any ‘reasonably representative’ certainty,”</span><span><strong> said Jeff Lyon, Fight for the Future’s Chief Technical Officer,</strong> </span><span>“Sunlight’s approach is like trying to draw conclusions about the average income in Massachusetts by only surveying people in Boston.” Lyon provided the following explanation of the serious errors he was able to identify in the FCC’s data and Sunlight’s analysis of it:</span></p>
<p><strong>There are two major problems with the data the FCC released and the resulting study:</strong></p>
<ol><li>
<p><span>The Sunlight Foundation based its study on the data released by the FCC in this</span><a href="http://www.fcc.gov/blog/fcc-releases-open-internet-reply-comments-public" target="_blank"><span> </span><span>October 22 blog post by Gigi Sohn</span></a><span>. However, the FCC failed to register hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments from Battle for the Net, and perhaps from other organizations.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Sunlight’s methodology was flawed. Sunlight was unable to parse all of the data released by the FCC. According to the FCC, there were 2.4 million comments in the data, but Sunlight was only able to read 1.6 million comments. Sunlight’s study is based on a subset of the data that misses one third of the data  in FCC&quot;s data dump; this data set is </span><span>not reasonably representative</span><span> of the big picture but in fact was comprised mainly of one set of comments. Furthermore, Sunlight significantly underreported the number of comments from Battle for the Net that the FCC actually recorded.</span></p>
</li>
</ol><p><em><strong>In actuality, there were at least 998,498 comments sent from Battle for the Net, but between the FCC not recording them and Sunlight applying a flawed methodology to analyze what little data there actually was, the end result was completely distorted.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>The FCC failed to register our comments:</strong></p>
<p><span>In the FCC’s release of the data, Ms. Sohn reports that the FCC received </span><span>725,169 comments</span><span> through ECFS and CSV uploads during the second comment period from July 19th to September 15th.</span></p>
<p><span>However, just between September 12th and September 15th, </span><span>Battle for the Net sent 527,953 comments through CSV uploads alone.</span><span> </span><span>We also submitted 470,596 more comments via ECFS and email.</span><span> Battle for the Net&rsquo;s numbers alone are far higher than the numbers reported by Ms. Sohn.</span></p>
<p><span>Given that numerous other individuals and organizations were submitting net neutrality comments during the same period, </span><span>at best the FCC is severely underreporting the number of comments sent out from pro-net neutrality activists.</span></p>
<p><span>To verify this, we downloaded and analyzed the</span><a href="http://www.fcc.gov/files/ecfs/14-28/R-14-28-02-SOLR-RAW.zip" target="_blank"><span> </span><span>data dump of all comments received by the FCC</span></a><span> during the second commenting period, and compared our data to the FCC’s. Please note that we have thus far only analyzed the 527,953 comments sent via CSV, and we are still processing reports on the data submitted by ECFS and email.</span></p>
<p><span>Total number of comments we submitted via CSV: </span><span>527,953</span></p>
<p><span>Almost all of these submissions used an</span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/letter/" target="_blank"><span> </span><span>open letter by Senator Angus King</span></a><span> with each participant signing on. To do a sanity test, we checked our CSV data for two of the phrases from the letter:</span></p>
<p><span>Number of occurrences of phrase: </span><span>‘These principles of fairness and openness’</span><span> in our CSV comments: </span><span>525,189 </span><span>(this number may be lower than actual due to aggressive deduplication)</span></p>
<p><span>Number of occurrences of phrase: </span><span>‘We are writing to urge you to implement’</span><span> in our CSV comments: </span><span>525,189 </span><span>(this number may be lower than actual due to aggressive deduplication)</span></p>
<p><span>Next, we scanned the data from the dump of FCC’s ECFS comments from the second commenting period.</span></p>
<p><span>Number of occurrences of phrase: </span><span>‘These principles of fairness and openness’</span><span> in FCC’s data dump of ECFS comments: </span><span>374,421</span></p>
<p><span>Number of occurrences of phrase: </span><span>‘We are writing to urge you to implement’</span><span> in FCC’s data dump of ECFS comments: </span><span>374,391</span></p>
<p><span>We identified 525,189 CSV comments, and found that at most the FCC only recorded 374,421. From this basic analysis alone, it is clear that, at best, the FCC missed a huge number of the comments we submitted via CSV. But we also sent over 470,596 more comments via email and through FCC’s ECFS site, (before it broke from all the load we put it under). Initial results are indicating that a large number of these comments submitted through email and ECFS were </span><span>also</span><span> not recorded by the FCC, but we are still generating reports to more precisely quantify those numbers.</span></p>
<p><span>We are running a more thorough analysis of the data to identify all the individuals whose comments were not recorded by the FCC, but crunching through all of this data will take several hours.</span></p>
<p><strong>Sunlight’s methodology was not “reasonably representative”.</strong></p>
<p><span>Sunlight was unable to parse all of the data released by the FCC. According to the FCC, there were 2.4 million comments in the data, but Sunlight was only able to read 1.6 million comments. They chose to base their conclusions on a subset of the data that may not be representative of the big picture. According to Sunlight’s own admission:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Clearly, 1.67 million documents is far short of 2.5 million (the number reported in the commission’s</span><a href="http://www.fcc.gov/blog/fcc-releases-open-internet-reply-comments-public" target="_blank"><span> </span><span>blog post</span></a><span>). We spent enough time with these files that we’re reasonably sure that the FCC’s comment counts are incorrect and that our analysis is reasonably representative of what’s there, but the fact that it’s impossible for us to know for sure is problematic</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Sunlight also significantly under-reported the number of comments that came from Battle for the Net commenters, estimating this at 271,608. When we pointed out how easily we identified at least 367,460 of our own comments in the data, they acknowledged their error. However, this margin alone could have been enough to tip their conclusions in favor of net neutrality activists.</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, the FCC confirmed that people who signed petitions would be counted as individual commenters. Many net-neutrality activist organizations attached their petition signatures as PDFs attached to single ECFS filings. Sunlight was unable to parse these PDFs and chose to simply exclude them from their sample pool, ignoring perhaps hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments. On the other hand, Sunlight was able to easily read all of American Commitment’s comments, further distorting their results in favor of anti-net neutrality commenters.</span></p>
<p><span>Sunlight applied a flawed sampling methodology to a flawed set of data, and drew conclusions that are impossible to make with any “reasonably representative” certainty.</span></p>

<h3>Net Neutrality activists interrupt FCC meeting, unfurl “Reclassify Now!” banner behind commissioners</h3>
<p><span>WASHINGTON, DC &ndash; This morning at 10:40am, net neutrality demonstrators interrupted the FCC’s monthly meeting by unfurling a large banner reading “Reclassify Now!” behind the seated FCC commissioners. The activists, both union members, were escorted from the room by security after speaking out and asking FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler why he continues to delay Title II net neutrality, which should have been voted on at today’s meeting.</span></p>
<p><strong>See photos of the action here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/cS43z" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/cS43z</a> </strong></p>
<p><strong>See a video of the action here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zr0L8aKZDxc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/embed/zr0L8aKZDxc </a><br/></strong></p>
<p><span>Other activists inside the meeting held paper signs calling for reclassification of the Internet under Title without delay. Several stood up and spoke to Chairman Wheeler from the floor to ask why net neutrality was left off the agenda before being escorted from the room. Outside, a crowd of protesters gathered with signs reading “Save the Internet! and “Reclassify Under Title II!”</span><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Activist Vanessa Beck of PopularResistance.org, who participated in the action, said “Nearly 4 million people submitted comments to the FCC on net neutrality, a record number, and more than 99% supported reclassification under Title II. If the FCC was a truly democratic agency, we would have a Title II rule today. Chairman Wheeler needs to stop stalling and listen to the public.”</span></p>
<p><span>While demonstrators made their voices heard at the FCC, digital rights group Fight for the Future, who helped publicize the protests, also rallied support online launching a new feature on </span><a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank"><span>CallTheFCC.com</span></a><span> that allows supporters to easily email FCC employees with a few clicks. The group has has helped drive more than </span><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/104245377138/press-release-net-neutrality-activists-give-the" target="_blank"><span>40,000 phone calls</span></a><span> to the FCC in recent months.</span></p>
<p><span>The disruption today was organized by PopularResistance.org, the activist group that helped lead </span><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank"><span>Occupy the FCC</span></a><span> and famously blockaded FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler’s driveway last month. Net neutrality supporters vowed to continue escalating their efforts until the FCC votes to approve Title II reclassification and protect the Internet from cable company abuse and censorship.</span><br/><br/><span>###</span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 16:40 EST on December 10, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/illinois-just-made-it-felony-film-cops/" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ngdysaFg2S1ri3xd7.jpg?1492021787434"/></span></a></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-486cc281-3622-0bbc-6c8a-dd6c31ad5250"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/illinois-just-made-it-felony-film-cops/" target="_blank">Illinois just passed a vague law that discourages people from recording their interactions with police by making it a felony to record cops and other government officials in certain circumstances.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The right to record our interactions with law enforcement and government officials is a basic freedom. It protects all of us from abuse. But the legislature of Illinois just hastily passed an amendment attached to a totally unrelated bill that will actually </span><span>increase</span><span> “penalties that people face if they record police or other officials in situations where they have a “reasonable expectation of privacy.” [1]</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is that the bill’s language is so vague that it will leave Illinois residents wondering whether and when they have the right to record their interactions with police. [2] This will have a chilling effect, and if it becomes a trend it and poses a threat to our First Amendment rights. Worse, this bill grants new authorities to police and informants to secretly record conversations without a warrant, [3]</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/illinois-just-made-it-felony-film-cops/" target="_blank">Sign the petition to the Governor of Illinois: veto the bill that makes it more illegal to record the cops than for them to record you.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>People from across the political spectrum all agree on one thing: we want more transparency and accountability from our government. Anytime a state passes a law that limits our freedom, it’s important that we push back to prevent it from becoming a dangerous trend.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/illinois-just-made-it-felony-film-cops/" target="_blank">Please click here to sign the petition,</a></strong><span> and then forward this email to as many people as you can.</span></p>
<p><span>More than 10,000 people have taken action on this in just the first few hours of us learning about the bill. If everyone signs and shares this we’ll almost certainly strike a major victory for free speech and privacy.</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,<br/>-Evan, Tiffiniy, and Holmes</span><span><br/></span><span>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. There’s some confusing information going around about this bill. For example, read </span><strong><a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/crime/eavesdroppinglaw.asp" target="_blank">this</a></strong><span>, and </span><strong><a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/12/no-illinois-didnt-ban-recordings-of-cops-but-they-did-get-more-power-to-eavesdrop-on-you/" target="_blank">this</a></strong><span><strong>.</strong> Our position is that this bill is a net negative for freedom because it imposes stronger penalties when people record police than when they record a civilian, causing a chilling effect, and it gives police and informants new power to record civilians without a warrant. </span><strong><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/illinois-just-made-it-felony-film-cops/" target="_blank">Read more here.</a></strong><span> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/892510804107148/" target="_blank"><span><strong>The FCC is stalling. They’re meeting on Thursday and somehow net neutrality is not on the agenda. Join us December 11th for a morning of protest at the FCC.</strong> </span><span><br/></span></a><span><br/>Hi Friend,<br/><br/></span><span>FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has delayed a vote on Net Neutrality until 2015 — and he’s probably hoping the public scrutiny will fade by then.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Guess what: It won&rsquo;t. And to make sure he knows it, we&rsquo;re showing up in person at the agency&rsquo;s final meeting of the year to remind Wheeler that we&rsquo;re #StillWatching him and will keep making noise until the FCC protects the open Internet.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/892510804107148/" target="_blank">We need you there next Thursday:</a></strong><span> All you need to do is grab some props (like oversized specs or a magnifying glass) and show up to join in the fun.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the details:</span></p>
<p><strong>What:</strong><span> Rally to Save the Internet: Net Neutrality Now</span></p>
<p><strong>When:</strong><span> Thurs., Dec. 11, 9–10 a.m.</span></p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><span> Outside FCC headquarters, 445 12th St. SW, Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><strong>RSVP: </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/892510804107148/" target="_blank"><span>Click here to tell us you&rsquo;re coming and invite your friends.</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Bring:</strong><span> A magnifying glass/specs and a sign calling for Title II, your cell phone, tablet, or laptop with </span><a href="http://protestsign.org" target="_blank"><span>ProtestSign.org</span></a><span> loaded!</span></p>
<p><span>At 10am toward the end of the rally, meet at the back of the protest on the sidewalk on 12th street with other net neutrality supporters who will be going inside the meeting and holding their phones silently in protest. Follow </span><a href="http://twitter.com/fightfortheftr" target="_blank"><strong>@fightfortheftr</strong></a><span> on the day of for updates.</span></p>
<p><span>Wheeler claims he needs more time to mull over Net Neutrality— but you and I both know that he has all the info he needs right now to reclassify Internet-access service under Title II. And there should be no doubt in his mind that reclassifying under Title II is the </span><span>only</span><span> way to protect the open Internet.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/892510804107148/" target="_blank">Join us on Dec. 11 to demand Net Neutrality now—</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Please RSVP if you can make it, and if not, please invite any friends you have in the area!</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for all you do,<br/>-Evan at FFTF</span></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2014-12-03-press-release-net-neutrality-activists-give-the/">PRESS RELEASE: Net neutrality activists give the FCC a holiday break</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 09:48 EST on December 3, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ng0iu0e5091ri3xd7.png?1492021787434"/></span></a></p>
<p><span>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>December 3, 2014<br/><br/>Media Contact:<br/>Evan Greer, Fight for the Future<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</span><span><br/><br/><strong>Net neutrality activists give FCC a holiday break, for one week they will stop driving thousands of phone calls</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Fight for the Future and other groups have driven more than 55,000 phone calls to desks at the FCC in the last two months, keeping phones at the agency ringing off the hook with voices for Title II</em></p>
<p><span>WASHINGTON &ndash; Today, net neutrality activists announced that, in the spirit of the holidays, they will be giving the FCC a one-week break from constant phone calls in support of Title II net neutrality. Internet freedom groups have bombarded 30 top officials at the agency with tens of thousands of phone calls since late September, when it appeared that FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler was preparing to ignore nearly 4 million public comments on the issue.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>To date, the page </span><strong><a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank">CallTheFCC.com</a></strong><span> has connected more than 55,000 phone calls to FCC staffers–nearly 1,000 every day for the last two months. More than 1,800 people have signed up to be “daily callers,” meaning they receive a reminder to call a new FCC official each day. Calls skip the FCC switchboard and go directly to the desks of 30 top officials.. FCC officials have told activists via email that their phones are ringing off the hook every hour of the business day.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>This morning, Fight for the Future emailed the 30 FCC employees who have been receiving calls to inform them that they’d be stopping the calls for one week, but that they should expect even more pressure after the FCC meets December 11th – if the FCC does not show clear signs it is moving quickly toward a vote on Title II net neutrality rules in January.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The statement below can be attributed to Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng:</strong><br/></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>The FCC should be accountable to the public, not the special interests of a select few companies. We know that monopolies like Comcast and Verizon spend tens of millions of dollars lobbying and are constantly calling and visiting the FCC to make sure that their position is heard. We built CallTheFCC.com to make sure that the public has the same opportunity.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>In the last few months, we’ve surrounded the FCC with protests and bombarded them with phone calls. </span><strong>Today, in the holiday spirit, we’ll be stopping the phone calls for one week</strong><span><strong>.</strong> We are giving the FCC the benefit of the doubt that they are finally listening to the overwhelming public consensus, and are moving toward a vote on strong Title II net neutrality rules in January. December 11th is FCC’s next meeting, and we will be there in force. If we don’t hear Chairman Wheeler make a strong statement indicating that his agency is listening to the public and moving toward Title II rules, we’ll redouble our calling efforts starting on December 12th, and unveil a new tool that makes it even easier for the public to make their voices heard at the FFC.<br/></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>CallTheFCC.com was built by Fight for the Future, and has been supported by Demand Progress, reddit, Free Press, MoveOn, CREDO Action, Democracy for America, and other netroots organizations.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Fight for the Future were lead organizers of the </span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/#infographic" target="_blank"><span>Internet Slowdown</span></a><span> on September 10th, which mobilized 40,000 websites in support of Title II net neutrality, and drove more than 750,000 FCC comments and 300,000 phone calls in a single day. They were also instrumental in organizing the </span><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank"><span>Occupy the FCC</span></a><span> encampment, which helped bring Title II into the national spotlight, and put it on the table as an option at the FCC.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>“There are so many people who want to speak out on net neutrality, that it’s amazing what happens when you give them an easy way to do it,” </span><strong>said Fight for the Future’s Chief Technical Officer Jeff Lyon,</strong><span><strong> who built CallTheFCC.com,</strong> “We know the people at the FCC are people too, so we’re happy to give them a week off. Hundreds of calls a day is a lot to handle. But they need to do the right thing and stop delaying the process in ways that benefit Cable companies and hurts the public. If the FCC </span><span>does</span><span> move forward with a strong net neutrality rule, we can direct all this attention to defending the FCC’s decision in Congress. There are millions of people ready to fight for net neutrality, the FCC’s choice is whether to side with those millions or go it alone.”</span><span><br/></span></p>
