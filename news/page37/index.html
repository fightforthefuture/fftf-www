<p><strong>SAMPLE TEXT FOR EMAIL OR BLOG POST:<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Copy and paste the text below.</strong></p>
<p><span> The e-mail is a call to action and instructions for how they can participate and join you on September 10th to save the open Internet.</span></p>
<p><span>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</span></p>
<p><span>If you woke up tomorrow, and your internet</span><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/#modal" target="_blank"> looked like this</a></strong><span>, what would you do? <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Imagine all your favorite websites taking forever to load, while you get annoying notifications from your ISP suggesting you switch to one of their approved “Fast Lane” sites.</span></p>
<p><span>Think about what we would lose: all the weird, alternative, interesting, and enlightening stuff that makes the Internet so much cooler than mainstream Cable TV. What if the only news sites you could reliably connect to were the ones that had deals with companies like Comcast and Verizon?</span></p>
<p><span>On September 10th, just a few days before the FCC’s comment deadline, public interest organizations are issuing an open, international call for websites and internet users to unite for an “Internet Slowdown” to show the world what the web would be like if Team Cable gets their way and trashes net neutrality. Net neutrality is hard to explain, so our hope is that this action will help SHOW the world what’s really at stake if we lose the open Internet.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’ve got a website, blog or tumblr, get the code to join the #InternetSlowdown here:</span><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/tools" target="_blank"> https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th</a></strong></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 13:12 EDT on September 3, 2014</span>


        <p id="docs-internal-guid-ed9c9e9b-3c77-0f5f-6dc0-dc9a6fe7bcc6"><span>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</span><span><br/></span><span>September 3, 2014</span></p>
<p><span>Media Contact:<br/>Evan Greer, Fight for the Future, <br/>Phone: 978-852-6457<br/>Email: </span><a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><span>press@fightforthefuture.org</span><span></span></a></p>
<p><strong>Advocates call for symbolic ‘Internet Slowdown’ to show what Web would be like without Net Neutrality.</strong></p>
<p><em>Battle for the Net groups representing more than 10 million people organize mass mobilization on Sept. 10 through creative online action before FCC deadline</em></p>
<p><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th" target="_blank"><em><img src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nbc53hoMG31r1kl7d.png"/></em></a></p>

<p><span>On Wednesday, a diverse range of public interest groups representing more than 10 million people announced a day of mass online mobilization on Sept. 10 in support of Net Neutrality. On that day, numerous websites, social networks, online activism organizations and others will call on their members to contact Washington and demand real Net Neutrality protections.  (Sites will employ icons that symbolize a slower Internet, but will not actually load more slowly.)</span><span><br/></span></p>
<p><strong>More information can be found at<a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/" target="_blank"> https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>There are many major tech companies and web platforms participating in the September 10th Internet Slowdown action. Those names, however, are currently confidential and will be released later this week.</strong></p>
<p><span>Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission proposed rules that would permit Internet service providers to extract tolls from websites, discriminate against online content, and undermine Net Neutrality. With a Sept. 15 deadline for public comments about this proposal rapidly approaching, the organizations will urge their members to submit comments to the FCC in opposition to the proposal and in support of rules that would protect Net Neutrality. They will also encourage members to email and call their elected officials to urge them to demand the FCC implement real Net Neutrality rules.</span></p>
<p><span>To date, more than 4 million people have expressed opposition to the FCC’s proposal, including via the submission of far more than a million formal comments. Additionally, the organizations are urging website owners — from the smallest blogs to the largest online platforms — to participate in the activism.  They can do so by displaying “widgets” available at</span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/" target="_blank"><span> </span><span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/" target="_blank">https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/</a></span></a><span> that will make it easy for those sites’ visitors to submit comments to the FCC. The widgets will symbolize slower content delivery by displaying the revolving icon &ndash; commonly used to symbolize slowly loading content &ndash; to demonstrate one way that the loss of Net Neutrality would harm websites and other online service.  (The sites will not actually load more slowly.)</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Those calling for the day of activism include:</strong>  The American Civil Liberties Union, Common Cause, Center for Media Justice, Color of Change, DailyKos, Demand Progress, Democracy for America, Democrats.com, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Engine Advocacy, Fight for the Future, FireDogLake, Free Press Action Fund, Future of Music Coalition, Greenpeace USA, Harry Potter Alliance, Media Alliance, MoveOn, National Hispanic Media Coalition, OpenMedia, Popular Resistance, Presente, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Progressives United, the Other 98%, RootsAction, Rootstrikers, SumOfUs, Voqal, Women, Action &amp; the Media,</span></p>
<p><strong>Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future, said, </strong><span>“Remember when there was only one major railroad company, and just a few banks? That&rsquo;s what Comcast&rsquo;s proposal will lead to &ndash;  a few dominant web companies shoved down our throats. Comcast&rsquo;s proposal would relegate all the weird, alternative, creative, personal, interesting, and independent content that makes the web so much cooler than Cable TV to a nether world most of us won&rsquo;t see. The FCC seems to think they can hide in their bunker in Washington, DC, but they&rsquo;ve both underestimated the fervor of the Internet scorned. Since Comcast and the FCC continue to work on slipping paid prioritization through, we&rsquo;re going to show the world what they&rsquo;re really calling for. The Internet will fight to the death before it lets any government or corporation trample online free expression.”</span></p>
<p><strong>David Segal, Executive Director of Demand Progress said,</strong><span> &ldquo;The ISPs have invested tens of millions of dollars in their effort to undermine Net Neutrality, but we still have a chance of defeating them &ndash; because the overwhelming majority of Americans stand with the Open Internet.  September 10th represents a chance for us to make that fact impossible to ignore.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>“Millions have made it clear that reclassifying ISPs as common carriers is the only way to ensure that the Internet remains a level playing field for all,” <strong>s</strong></span><strong>aid Michael Scurato, policy director of the National Hispanic Media Coalition.</strong><span> “For Latinos and other communities who have suffered discrimination at the hands of traditional media, this is crucial. Allowing Internet Service Providers to discriminate would come at a high cost, as history has shown that if diverse and dissenting voices can be blocked, they will be.”</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Millions already have spoken out against the FCC&rsquo;s slow-lane scheme, but FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler seems to think if he hides out in Washington the public will lose interest,&rdquo; </span><strong>said Craig Aaron, president and CEO of Free Press.</strong><span> &ldquo;But the public outcry is only growing louder — and next week&rsquo;s Internet slowdown will show millions more people what a world without real Net Neutrality would look like. If you claim to support the free and open Internet, you must pick a side in this battle. And being on Team Internet means you support reclassifying broadband under Title II of the Communications Act. There&rsquo;s still a spot for Tom Wheeler on Team Internet, but only if he heeds the public and changes course now.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>According to Evan Engstrom, Policy Director for Engine Advocacy, </strong><span>&ldquo;Despite what cable companies want you to believe, net neutrality has been the norm in this country for most of the Internet’s existence, and it is one of the key reasons we have a strong startup sector driving the nation’s economy. The FCC’s proposed plan would radically alter how the Internet functions, slowing down all but the most well-heeled incumbent companies and pricing the next wave of innovative startups out of the market. If the FCC has any interest in ensuring that the Internet remains a viable platform for economic growth, it must reclassify broadband as a Title II service.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>More background:</strong></p>
<p><span>The FCC’s proposal would be a huge boon for the cable companies, and would undermine the Internet as we know it. Under the proposed rules, cable giants like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon would be able to create a two-tiered Internet, with slow lanes (for most of us) and fast lanes (for wealthy corporations that are willing pay fees in exchange for fast service).</span></p>
<p><span>Cable companies would have the power to discriminate against online content and applications — they could pick winners and losers, shake sites down for fees, block content for political reasons, and make it easier for Internet users to view content the cable companies own.</span></p>
<p><span>But the FCC left open the possibility of issuing a stronger rule by reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act and requiring Internet service providers to deliver all content at equal speeds.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCC is expected to issue a final rule as soon as the end of the year.</span></p>

<p><strong>Dear Fight for the Future member,</strong></p>
<p><span>If you woke up tomorrow, and your internet </span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/#modal" target="_blank"><span>looked like this</span></a><span>, what would you do? </span></p>
<p><span>Imagine all your favorite websites taking forever to load, while you get annoying notifications from your ISP suggesting you switch to one of their approved “Fast Lane” sites</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Think about what we would lose: all the weird, alternative, interesting, and enlightening stuff that makes the Internet so much cooler than mainstream Cable TV. What if the only news sites you could reliably connect to were the ones that had deals with companies like Comcast and Verizon?</span></p>
<p><span>How would your worldview be different? Do you think you’d have found Fight for the Future or other causes you care about? Would you be getting this email?</span></p>
<p><span>On September 10th, just a few days before the FCC’s comment deadline, public interest organizations are issuing an open, international call for websites and internet users to unite for an “Internet Slowdown” to show the world what the web would be like if Team Cable gets their way and trashes net neutrality. </span></p>
<p><span>We need everyone on board for this. Got a website or blog? Find out how the slowdown works and how you can join here: </span><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/tools" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th</a></strong></p>
<p><span>If you don’t have a website, you are still part of this! </span><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/96020972118/be-a-part-of-the-great-internet-slowdown" target="_blank"><span>H<strong>ere’s a quick list of things you can do to help in the Battle for the Net. </strong></span></a></p>
<p><span>This isn’t about how quickly our cat videos load, it’s about the future of our ability to communicate, to learn, to create, and to rebel. It’s about the future of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span>The SOPA blackout proved that even concentrated monopoly and government power is no match for the power of people’s voices connected and amplified by the free and open web. </span></p>
<p><span>That power is one of the few things we have in this fight for the future. This could be one of our last chances to defend it. If we lose it, we lose a lot more than just the Internet. If we win, we win a lot more than just streaming video. The stakes are high and we should be acting like it.</span></p>
<p><span>The Internet is counting on each and every one of us to act. </span><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th" target="_blank">Let’s not let ourselves down. See you on the net September 10th!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>For the future,</span></p>
<p><span>-Evan, Tiffiniy, Holmes, and the FFTF team</span></p>

        <p><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/ferguson" target="_blank"><strong>Urgent: Cops in Ferguson are strangling free speech. Take action now!</strong><span><br/></span><span><img alt="image" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_namgjeDyWd1r1kl7d.png"/></span></a></p>
<p><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>For the past several nights I’ve been glued to the Internet watching livestreams and social media coming out of Ferguson, MO. It’s been heartwrenching, but has also reminded me why I care so much about Internet freedom: </span><span>it allows for free speech and discussion like never before. </span></p>
<p><span>I’m sure you’ve seen the videos and photos: cops firing tear gas and concussion grenades into residential neighborhoods, threatening and arresting journalists at gunpoint, and brutally suppressing protesters standing with their hands in the air chanting, “Hands up! Don’t shoot!”[1][2]</span></p>
<p><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/ferguson" target="_blank"><span><img alt="image" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_namgx3nSHv1r1kl7d.jpg"/></span></a></p>

<p><span>The images are frightening. But even more frightening is the reality that this type of crackdown could become commonplace, thanks to millions of dollars of Federal funding that incentivize police forces to resemble an invading army. It has to stop.</span></p>
<p><span>Technology should be used to amplify people’s voices, not silence them. As an organization that advocates for tech in the public interest, we felt we have a real role to play to make this stop. <br/><br/></span><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/ferguson" target="_blank">Right now Congress is considering legislation that would demilitarize local police forces. Click here to tell your lawmakers to cut funding for the weapons of war used to suppress free speech.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>I’ve seen this type of behavior from police before &ndash; after a quick poll we discovered 50% of the Fight for the Future team has been teargassed at demonstrations at one time or another. But this time the abuse has been so egregious that there have been calls from both left and right demanding to know: </span><span>just how did it get this way?</span></p>
<p><span>The story goes a lot like the story of how we got into this mess with NSA surveillance. Defense contractors working their magic in Washington, DC got the Department of Homeland Security to start offering more than $30 billion in grants to local police departments for all kinds of crowd control “toys.”[3] They received even more weaponry through the 1033 transfer program that put military-grade weapons directly in the hands of local cops. [4] <strong>Defense contractors profit greatly off of this program</strong>, which has created a dangerous situation where local police are compelled to use what weapons they have on crowds of people expressing themselves.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_namha3y0D11r1kl7d.jpg"/></span></p>
<p><span>The police violence in Ferguson brought this secretive history hurtling into view. </span><span>Barack Obama and Rand Paul (neither of whom I’m a big fan of) have both made statements suggesting that police should not be silencing voices of dissent and brutalizing journalists with weapons of military occupation. [5][6] </span><span>But talk is cheap. We need action right now.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/ferguson" target="_blank">Will you sign the petition? We have a path forward to end this tyranny. Here’s something concrete and meaningful that we can do right now to protect our right to dissent.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Despite the enforced media blackout, it’s been relatively easy to get breaking news out of Ferguson thanks to free and uncensored Internet. (Oh, except on Facebook, but that’s another story. [7]) Through livestreams, twitter, and various blogs, I’ve watched with my own eyes and saw a SWAT officer rip a press badge off of VICE News reporter Tim Pool, saying “this doesn’t mean shit” while separating “credentialed” reporters from citizen journalists. [8] I watched cops with submachine guns telling journalists to “separate themselves” from protesters and get in their “designated area.” [9][10]</span></p>
<p><span>Everybody wants to live in safe cities. Nobody likes getting mugged. But if we give our police free reign to buy the latest sub-lethal grenades, chemical weapons or surveillance gadgets the military industrial complex cooks up, it’s only a matter of time before they use them in terrible ways against people like us. </span><span>If this goes unchecked, the next Ferguson will be a lot worse.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/ferguson" target="_blank">Tell your representatives to protect the 1st amendment and cut funding for police brutality. </a></strong></p>
<p><span>We’ve learned all too well in the last year how dangerous technology can be when it’s used against us rather than for us. Now is our chance to make it clear that no government or corporation should be able to accumulate weapons and technology for the purpose of suppressing free speech and a free press. </span></p>
<p><span>It’s going to take a lot more than contacting Congress to dismantle the underlying injustices that have lead to the uprising and repression in Ferguson, but for the first time in a long time, we have a real chance to turn the tide on this issue, and make the world a safer place for when our children stand up to protest the things that they see wrong in the world.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>For freedom online and off,<br/></span></strong><span>-Evan at Fight for the Future, with love from the whole team</span></p>

<p><span>P.S. While #Ferguson has definitely occupied some of my mind lately, it’s mostly just strengthened my resolve to keep fighting for the free and open Internet. It’s going to be a long road to justice, but the Internet gives us a chance. </span><a href="https://medium.com/message/ferguson-is-also-a-net-neutrality-issue-6d2f3db51eb0" target="_blank"><span>This article</span></a><span> says a lot of things about Ferguson and the open Internet that I have been thinking but couldn’t have articulated so well. Very worth a read and a share. </span></p>
<p><span>If you’re feeling like you want to do more to support people on the ground in Ferguson speaking out in the face of overwhelming police violence, </span><a href="https://secure.piryx.com/donate/mS25KFCe/MORE/mikebrown" target="_blank"><span>please donate to the bail fund</span></a><span> that’s been set up for protesters there. </span></p>
