      <h1><a href="/news/2015-10-24-new-facebook-quietly-lobbying-for-cisa-while/">NEW: Facebook quietly lobbying for CISA while being shielded by trade associations</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 11:23 EDT on October 24, 2015</span>


        <h2><i>Edward Snowden promotes Fight for the Future’s campaign demanding Facebook come clean</i></h2><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 24, 2015</p><p>Contact: Tiffiniy Cheng, 413-367-6255, press@fightforthefuture.org</p><p>New information has surfaced about Facebook&rsquo;s position on S. 754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA). Sources on the Hill tell us that Facebook lobbyists are welcoming CISA behind closed doors, even though Facebook has been lauded as opposing the bill after CCIA, an industry association they are a member of, came out against it.. CISA would give companies like Facebook legal immunity for violating privacy laws as long as they share information with the government. It’s supposed to be for cybersecurity, but in reality companies would be encouraged to share information beyond cyber threat data and the information could be used for prosecuting all kinds of activities.<br/></p><p>Based on this information, Fight for the Future has launched a petition demanding that Facebook come clean about its stance on CISA: <a href="https://www.youbetrayedus.org/facebook" target="_blank">https://www.youbetrayedus.org/facebook</a> <br/></p><p><b></b></p><p>NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden tweeted about the campaign last night: <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/658398460954214400" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/658398460954214400</a> </p><p>Facebook has come under public fire for its permissive use of user data and pioneering privacy-invasive experiments in the past. They have also supported previous versions of the cybersecurity info-sharing bills, and their chief Senate lobbyist, Myriah Jordan, worked as General Counsel for CISA’s sponsor, Senator Richard Burr, immediately before moving to Facebook. Facebook has declined to take a public position on CISA, but in recent days sources have confirmed that in fact Facebook is quietly lobbying the Senate to pass it. Fight for the Future has launched a <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org/facebook" target="_blank">campaign to demand Facebook</a> take a public position. </p><p>“At a time when CISA is being rejected by the public, security experts, and even the tech industry it’s supposed to protect, it was suspicious that Congress is barrelling forward with this bill at breakneck speed. Now, it seems we have part of the answer. Facebook&rsquo;s quiet lobbying is an example of why Facebook will go down as the most hated tech company in history,” <b>said Fight for the Future Co-director Tiffiniy Cheng,</b> “If Facebook wants to reclaim their credibility on user privacy, they need to take a stand against CISA.”</p><p><b>Background: </b></p><p>Last month, the Business Software Alliance, which represents Apple, Microsoft, and other major tech companies, clarified that<a href="http://www.bsa.org/policy/security" target="_blank"> it does not support</a> any of the three information sharing bills before Congress after Fight for the Future ran<a href="http://youbetrayedus.org" target="_blank"> a public campaign</a> called YouBetrayedUs and initiated a<a href="http://youbetrayedus.org/heroku" target="_blank"> boycott of Heroku</a>, the web hosting service owned by Salesforce, that spurred a flurry of angry emails from consumers targeting companies that signed a BSA letter that appeared to support CISA. Salesforce’s CEO also<a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/129854286868/breaking-facing-public-backlash-salesforce-ceo" target="_blank"> took to twitter</a> condemning the BSA letter and saying his company opposes CISA.</p><p>The grassroots campaigns have sparked an avalanche of opposition from the tech industry as well. In the last two weeks, <a href="https://twitter.com/policy/status/656288688364609536" target="_blank"> Twitter</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Yelp/status/655938689952976896" target="_blank">Yelp</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/reddit/status/654714193040400384" target="_blank"> reddit</a>, and<a href="https://twitter.com/wikimediapolicy/status/655179547994816512" target="_blank"> Wikipedia</a> weighed in against CISA. CCIA, an industry association representing tech giants, including Facebook, as well as Google, Yahoo, Amazon, Sprint, and others, also<a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/131222608488/breaking-trade-group-representing-google" target="_blank"> issued a statement</a> slamming the bill. Mozilla, imgur, Wordpress, Craigslist, Namecheap, and hundreds of other companies have opposed CISA and similar information sharing legislation in the past.</p><p>“The U.S. government’s deplorable surveillance programs and pathetic cybersecurity have already severely damaged the public’s trust in tech companies and Congress,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. “If they choose to ignore the overwhelming opposition to this bill and pass it anyway, that damage could become irreparable. This moment will go down in history, and politicians need to decide which side of history they want to be on: the side that fought for freedom or the side that gave it away.”</p><p>Fight for the Future and other groups generated millions of emails, petition signatures, calls, tweets, and more than<a href="http://faxbigbrother.com" target="_blank"> 6.2 million faxes</a> to members of Congress (although it appears that the Senate<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3pjmb7/the_senate_lost_hundreds_of_thousands_of_faxes/" target="_blank"> may have blocked</a> or otherwise lost the vast majority of the faxes, a disturbing footnote given the disconnect between Congress’ discussions of the bill and the overwhelming public opposition). The hashtag #CISA has also been<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CISA?src=hash" target="_blank"> completely flooded</a> with tweets opposing the bill.</p><p>The bill, which has been lambasted by security experts, privacy activists, and major tech companies, would give corporations legal immunity to share data with the U.S. government, a move that experts say would not prevent cyber attacks but could enable sweeping new levels of government surveillance.</p><p>A final vote is expected on Tuesday.</p><p>###</p>

They’re best known for organizing the massive online protests against SOPA, for net neutrality, and against government surveillance.

        <span class="date">Posted 12:40 EDT on October 22, 2015</span>


        <p>On Tuesday, 
October 27, the European Parliament will vote on rules intended to 
protect network neutrality in the European Union (EU). However, the 
proposal about to be adopted fails to deliver real network neutrality to the 
EU and is much weaker than current rules in the United 
States. <br></p>
<p><b>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s not too late to change course.</b> Members of 
Parliament can still secure meaningful network neutrality for 
Europe&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;if they adopt key amendments on Tuesday.</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 20:01 EDT on October 21, 2015</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="519" data-orig-width="956"><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/01fe807f6a93cc7e534d695b546ea29c/tumblr_inline_nwlhm7QM0m1ri3xd7_540.jpg" data-orig-height="519" data-orig-width="956"/></figure><p>A video from October 15th has recently emerged showing Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) seemingly confused by a question about the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, and admitting that he has not yet read the bill, which is currently on the Senate floor and expected to come to a crucial vote within days.<br/></p><p><b>View the video here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/internet2016/videos/1505163873142638/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/internet2016/videos/1505163873142638/</a></b> </p><p>“I will confess that that is not a bill that I have studied,” Cruz responded when asked by an audience member about the controversial bill at an event in Kalona, Iowa. He went on to express that he has privacy concerns about data collection “across the board” but reiterated “I have not examined that particular bill.”</p><p>Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng had this to say in response to the video, “Ted Cruz’s confused response about CISA underscores the fact that Congress has no clue what they are voting on, and even less of a clue how to actually address critical cybersecurity issues. Security experts, tech companies who actually deal with cyber attacks, and privacy advocates all agree this bill is not only flawed but dangerous. I sincerely hope that Ted Cruz and the rest of Congress can take some time out of their busy campaigning schedules to actually read this bill before they vote on it.”</p><p>Feel free to reach out to us for more. We’re working on getting a version of the video up on YouTube to make it easier to embed.</p><p>Best,</p><p>-Evan at FFTF</p><p><a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a> </p><p>P.S.

The group also initiated a <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org/heroku" target="_blank">boycott of Heroku</a>, the webhosting service owned by Salesforce, which prompted Salesforce’s CEO to <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/129854286868/breaking-facing-public-backlash-salesforce-ceo" target="_blank">take to twitter</a> condemning the BSA letter and saying his company opposes CISA. </p><p>The group continued to make headlines by calling for the <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/130360813438/fight-for-the-future-calls-for-experian-ceo-to" target="_blank">CEO of Experian to resign</a> over his company’s support for CISA after a devastating hack exposed the private data of 15 million T-Mobile customers. Just yesterday, following a viral AP story about Hillary Clinton’s cybersecurity failings as Secretary of State, Fight for the Future <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/131494557888/despite-ap-story-detailing-cybersecurity-failures" target="_blank">launched a petition</a> calling for her to state her position on CISA, noting that her opponent Bernie Sanders opposes the bill. </p><p>Fight for the Future and a large coalition of other groups are watching CISA’s progress closely and are preparing for a final showdown on the Senate floor. Senators that expect to maintain their constuents trust would do well to take note of the rising level of opposition to this toxic legislation, which is now only supported by a few self-interested corporations and lawmakers who have a track record of voting to expand and maintain unpopular government surveillance programs.</p><p>###</p><p>Fight for the Future is a grassroots advocacy group with more than 1.4 million members that fights to protect the Internet as a powerful platform for freedom of expression and social change. They’re best known for organizing the massive online protests against SOPA, for net neutrality, and against government surveillance.
