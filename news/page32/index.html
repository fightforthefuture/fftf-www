        <p><a href="https://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank"><span><img alt="image" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nejmhv20gk1ri3xd7.jpg"/></span></a></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-8eafc3c4-7d41-d3aa-c41d-082c505c5f81"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Click here to join an emergency protest for net neutrality on November 6th!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Did you hear about the massive protests in Hungary? The government there proposed an Internet Tax, that would have charged ordinary internet users exorbitant prices *per gigabite.*</span></p>
<p><span>Thousands of people took to the streets in protest, holding their shining cell phones aloft as a symbol of resistance to the unfair Internet Tax. In response, the government announced they would lower the tax.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead of accepting the compromise, even more people took to the streets demanding unfettered, affordable access to the free and open web. </span><span>And they won. The government backed down and took the controversial tax off the table.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s election day here in the U.S. and we face a similar crisis. Regardless of which party comes out on top today, the FCC is set to annihilate net neutrality and open the floodgates for rampant Internet censorship and abuse. This is the moment we’ve been building for. In the last year, Fight for the Future has grown to more than 1 million members! We are stronger than we’ve ever been and we have the power to save net neutrality, </span><span>but signing petitions and making phone calls isn’t going to be enough.</span></p>
<p><span>This Thursday, November 6th we’re organizing emergency protests across the country, but we need more people to step up and help “anchor” protests in their towns. Anchoring a protest is easy: it just means you pick a time and location, and agree to be there and get as many of your friends as possible to come. The protests themselves are simple: we are asking people to gather in the evening at government buildings and hold their glowing cell phones, laptops, and tablets aloft to shine light on the growing corruption in DC and demand real net neutrality.</span></p>
<p><span>We, and several other groups with large email lists, will send an email to our thousands of members in your area encouraging them to attend your event. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Click here to join an emergency protest or start one in your town.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>You can also reply to this email if you are able to help anchor a protest and we’ll get in touch with you right away. </span></p>
<p><span>The protests on Thursday will be the kickoff for a month of escalating actions leading up to the FCC’s final decision, which we expect to come in early December. We’ll be holding these vigils every Thursday leading up until that point, so if you can help organize one any time in the coming weeks, let us know! Just reply to this email, we’ll see it.</span></p>
<p><strong>We’ve updated <a href="https://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">https://Battleforthenet.com</a></strong><span><strong> to support these emergency protests.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Please share the link far and wide and tell as many people as possible that the fight for net neutrality is coming to a head and we need to start something big right now.</span></p>
<p><span>For the Internet,<br/>-Evan at Fight for the Future</span></p>

<p><em>FFTF co-founder Holmes Wilson published this op-ed in The Hill today.</em></p>
<p>Link: <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/222721-why-obama-deserves-to-lose-the-senate-today" target="_blank">http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/222721-why-obama-deserves-to-lose-the-senate-today</a></p>
<p>The Internet has been game-changing in nearly every important political moment. From the Arab Spring to Occupy, from Ferguson to feminism, groups facing oppression have a chance to control their own narrative, introducing topics too complex and provocative for traditional, top-down media. </p>
<p>Today, how average people feel about an issue finally, actually matters. When something important happens, public discourse can be more than soundbites crammed down our throats by paid (read: corrupted) professionals. When Ferguson or Gamergate happens, we can actually learn from it. </p>
When activists make a<a href="http://www.ihollaback.org/blog/2014/10/27/new-street-harassment-psa/" target="_blank"> video decrying street harassment</a>, for example, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_Mba-AZ__Q" target="_blank">absurd response</a> on cable news is just icing on the cake. The hundreds of millions of people who watched the video directly, on their own terms, have already gotten the point (that what women in American cities go through every day is just unacceptable). 
<p>For those of us who came of age in America&rsquo;s dark days of post-9/11 hysteria, George Bush, and cable news (not to mention a cleverly co-opted New York Times that<a href="http://fair.org/take-action/action-alerts/the-scoop-that-got-spiked/" target="_blank"> sat on the news of warrantless wiretapping</a> for a year and<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/30/weekinreview/the-public-editor-weapons-of-mass-destruction-or-mass-distraction.html" target="_blank"> pumped up the WMD threat</a> in Iraq) it&rsquo;s impossible to overstate the difference. </p>
<p>But America&rsquo;s telecommunication and media giants are threatening to return us to that pre-Internet dark age. And Barack Obama–who more than any other American president has benefited from the open Internet and promised to protect it– is helping them do it. </p>
<p>The issue is net neutrality, the ability for people to connect online without interference from cable companies. The cable industry wants power over what sites and services people use, to start applying the confusing pricing– the kind that lets them charge such ridiculous amounts for TV– to the Internet. </p>
<p>If they win, your access to cable-sanctioned services will get fast and cheap, while access to millions of other voices on the Internet will get slow and expensive, perhaps impossible. </p>
<p>Obama has spoken out for net neutrality dozens of times, from the <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/obama-pledges-net-neutrality-laws-if-elected-president/" target="_blank">campaign trail</a>, to <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/10/obama_vs_tom_wheeler_the_president_s_statement_on_net_neutrality_was_huge.html" target="_blank">just weeks ago</a>. And he&rsquo;s <em>saying</em> the right things. </p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s where it ends. Obama&rsquo;s pick to run the FCC–the agency with the power to enforce net neutrality– is a former lobbyist for both cable companies and telcos. </p>
<p>Despite having hand picked the FCC’s leadership, the Obama administration is pretending to have no power over the FCC. This is not true. Obama has the power to remove Tom Wheeler from his position as FCC chair and replace him with one of the other commissioners. If that’s not power, what is? </p>
<p>Then, last week, the FCC&rsquo;s current plans leaked to the Wall Street Journal. Even though millions of Americans supported net neutrality, this proposal gave us the opposite: fastlanes for those who pay, and slowlanes for everyone else. </p>
<p>At this point, we no longer feel like we&rsquo;re speaking to an administration (and especially an FCC Chairman) that&rsquo;s operating in good faith. Four million Americans and nearly the entire tech community speak out, and the FCC does the opposite. This looks like simple corruption and–given everything Obama has promised his voters, volunteers, and donors on net neutrality–hypocrisy.  </p>
<p>And more than anything else, we see this as a pattern. Whether it&rsquo;s the financial crisis, health care, immigration reform, or climate change, the Obama administration always <em>says</em> the right things. But when it comes time to act, it caves to elite power, again and again. </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s candidacy promised an escape from the dark ages of Bush, cable news, and a war built on hysteria. Now, by breaking his promises on net neutrality, Obama&rsquo;s legacy will be to actually return us to that dark age, where our entire Internet experience will have the thumbprints of  top-down big cable/media conglomerates all over it.</p>
<p>Today, America goes to the polls. Obama&rsquo;s party is expected to suffer a series of defeats, and lose control of Congress. Is it any wonder? This was a turnout election, the people who care most about an open Internet are those without power, and Obama hasn’t fought for them. From where we sit, they deserve to lose.</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 14:07 EDT on October 31, 2014</span>


        <p><span>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>Friday, October 31st<br/><br/>Media Contact:<br/>Tiffiniy Cheng, 413-367-6255<br/>Email: </span><a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><span>press@fightforthefuture.org</span></a><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Fight for the Future delivers 75,000 signatures to President Obama demanding he support Title II net neutrality and replace failed FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler</strong> </span></p>
<p><em>Internet activists are outraged by so-called &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; proposal reported by Wall Street Journal that would allow for fast lanes and slow lanes.</em></p>
<p><span><strong>WASHINGTON &ndash;</strong> Today, digital rights group Fight for the Future &ndash; best known for their pivotal role in major Internet protests like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown &ndash; electronically delivered <strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/obama" target="_blank">more than 75,000 signatures</a></strong> to President Barack Obama calling for the White House to publicly support full Title II reclassification and demote FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler for failing to do his job protecting the public’s access to a free and open Internet.</span></p>
<p><span>The delivery came just hours after the Wall Street Journal reported that Wheeler is close to finalizing a net neutrality proposal that would explicitly allow for Internet fast lanes and slow lanes, despite the fact that the FCC has received more than 3.7 million public comments opposing the fast lanes, overwhelmingly in support of banning so-called “paid prioritization” through the use of Title II reclassification.</span></p>
<p><span>“The Internet will never accept this sham proposal &ndash; it’s a middle finger to the American public and Internet users around the world,” <strong>said Holmes Wilson, co-founder of Fight for the Future,</strong> “Four million people came out opposing fast lanes, and then the FCC proposes fastlanes. It’s an outrage.” </span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;President Obama risks becoming the poster child for modern corruption. He appointed a former cable industry lobbyist to chair the FCC who has been doing the Cable industry&rsquo;s bidding,” <strong>said FFTF’s other co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng,</strong> “If the FCC goes with the proposal detailed in the Wall Street Journal and fails to protect the most basic principles of the open Internet, that failure rests with the Obama administration. ”</span></p>
<p><span>Following today’s petition delivery calling for Wheeler’s removal from the FCC Chairmanship, Fight for the Future announced plans for a series of escalating actions targeting both the White House and the FCC.</span></p>
<p><span>The group is currently running a campaign at </span><strong><a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank">CallTheFCC.com</a></strong><span>, which allows Internet users to enter their phone number and call a random top-level employee at the FCC. The page has already driven more than 10,000 phone calls to the FCC, and more than 700 committed activists have signed up to call the FCC every day from now until they announce their net neutrality decision. </span></p>
<p><span>Fight for the Future and other groups are also planning an </span><strong><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/emergency" target="_blank">Emergency Protest</a></strong><span> at the White House on Thursday, November 6th. Inspired by massive protests against a proposed Internet Tax in Hungary, the organizers are calling for participants to hold their phones aloft as a symbol of protest against the gutting of Internet freedom.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re just getting started &ndash; the public is outraged and our actions will reflect that,” <strong>added Evan Greer, FFTF’s Campaign Director,</strong> “If President Obama and Tom Wheeler think they can fool the Internet public into accepting a fake proposal that destroys net neutrality, they are sorely mistaken, and with elections coming up, their party may pay the ultimate political price.”</span></p>
