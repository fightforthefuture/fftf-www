      <h1><a href="/news/2015-10-29-fight-for-the-future-is-stoked-that-the-eu">Fight for the Future is stoked that the EU Parliament just voted to drop all charges against Edward Snowden and protect him from extradition to the U.S.</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:06 EDT on October 29, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 29, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a> </p><p>Today the European Union’s parliament <b><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-10/29/edward-snowden-asylum-european-union" target="_blank">voted 285 - 281</a> </b>on a nonbinding resolution encouraging member states to drop all criminal charges against NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and protect him from extradition to the United States.<br/></p><p>Fight for the Future, a leading digital rights group based in the U.S. celebrated this news and released the following statement, which can be attributed to campaign director, Evan Greer:</p><blockquote><p><i>“The battle over mass government surveillance is a decisive moment in the history of humanity, and it’s hard to think of anyone who has done more than Edward Snowden to educate the public about the grave risks that runaway spying programs pose to our basic human rights, the future of the Internet, and freedom of expression.</i></p><p><i>The European Parliament agrees with the vast majority of people in the world that Edward Snowden is a courageous whistleblower whose actions have made us all safer. The United States government should be ashamed that it continues to criminalize Snowden and torture and imprison other whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning. </i></p><p><i>We hope that this resolution leads to a binding agreement in the EU that allows Edward Snowden to move to whichever EU country he wants, and we hope he gets an epic party thrown in his honor when he arrives.” </i></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a> (FFTF) has been on the frontlines of the fight to end the U.S. government’s mass surveillance programs since Edward Snowden first exposed them. They released <a href="http://thensavideo.com" target="_blank">“The NSA Video,”</a> narrated by actress Evangeline Lilly, and projected it onto the side of a building in Manhattan, leading to more than 440,000 views on YouTube. </p><p>The group also ran a <a href="http://thanksnowden.com" target="_blank">“Thank Edward Snowden”</a> campaign where more than 10,000 people publicly thanked Edward Snowden with heartfelt images. On the first anniversary of the original Snowden revelations, Fight for the Future organized the largest online campaign against surveillance in history, <a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">Reset the Net</a>. It rallied the participation of thousands of major tech companies, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/edward-snowden-privacy-reset-the-net" target="_blank">was endorsed</a> by Edward Snowden himself through a written statement and on a video interview. </p><p>Recently, Fight for the Future has lead a series of <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/131739253638/photos-anti-cisa-activists-spell-out-no-cisa" target="_blank">high profile campaigns</a> in fierce opposition to CISA, a cyber surveillance bill that passed the U.S. Senate on Monday. Edward Snowden also bolstered those efforts, joining <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/132011437168/edward-snowden-weighs-in-on-cisa-its-not-going" target="_blank">FFTF’s reddit Q&amp;A</a> about the bill, and tweeting his support. </p>

Every Senator who voted for CISA has voted for a world without freedom of expression, a world without true democracy, a world without basic human rights.</i></p><p><i>But perhaps most importantly, they have voted to make utter fools of themselves and proved that they have absolutely no clue how to prevent cyber attacks. By supporting a bill that has been resoundingly rejected by security experts, tech companies, and advocacy groups from across the political spectrum, these politicians have highlighted the brokenness of our political system and exposed the reality that U.S. Congress is one of the Internet’s greatest foes. If President Obama doesn’t veto this bill, he’ll be showing that his administration never cared about the open Internet, despite his posturing on net neutrality.</i></p><p><i>Everyone knows that CISA is not what these corrupt politicians are claiming it is. Thanks to the Internet, it’s already easy to see when Congress is being clueless and dishonest – soon, we’ll be able to hold them accountable too, and it’s only a matter of time. </i></p><p><i>There is so much more that internet users can do to defend their privacy from this Congress. Fight for the Future will continue to fight on the frontlines to protect the Internet as a powerful platform for freedom of expression and social change. In the coming months, we will be returning to our campaign to defend and expand the use of strong encryption: <a href="https://www.resetthenet.org/" target="_blank">Reset the Net</a>.</i></p></blockquote><p>Despite today’s vote, the fight over CISA is not over yet. The bill must still be “conferenced” with similar legislation in the House of Representatives, and then signed by President Obama. Fight for the Future intends to fight this dangerous measure at every step, and will hold lawmakers and companies accountable for supporting it or standing idly by and allowing it to pass.</p><p>Fight for the Future and Restore the Fourth will be updating their<a href="http://www.decidethefuture.org/#scoreboard" target="_blank"> <b>“legislative scorecard”</b></a> based on the CISA vote. Lawmakers who supported the measure will receive -4 points, pushing many of them onto “Team Surveillance.”</p><p>For more on Fight for the Future’s recent campaigns around CISA, which have generated millions of messages to Congress against the bill and lead to an avalanche of large tech companies coming out in opposition, <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/131739253638/photos-anti-cisa-activists-spell-out-no-cisa" target="_blank"><b>see this previous release</b></a>, which includes high-resolution photos of CISA related protests that are available for use by press. </p><p>Note: Greer’s pronouns are she/hers.</p><p>###</p><p><i>Fight for the Future is a grassroots advocacy group with more than 1.4 million members that fights to protect the Internet as a powerful platform for freedom of expression and social change.

It&rsquo;s not going to make us any safer. It&rsquo;s a surveillance bill. What it allows is for the companies you interact with every day &ndash; visibly, like Facebook, or invisibly, like AT&amp;T &ndash; to indiscriminately share private records about your interactions and activities with the government.”</p><p>The reddit Q&amp;A also featured representatives from Access, EFF, and Demand Progress as well as <b><a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/658767505352171520" target="_blank">Senator Ron Wyden</a>,</b> who has been one of the strongest Congressional opponents of CISA. </p><p>Snowden, who of course understands the inside of the United States’ surveillance programs better than most, went on to explain how CISA will enable new types of government spying: </p><blockquote><p><i>“In theory, this is supposed to allow the government to sort through what is in effect the entire private network space of civil society within the United States for &ldquo;indicators of compromise,&rdquo; or, more simply, red flags that indicate a hack has happened. The problem is that the NSA, FBI, and other organizations already do this on a higher level of the network under other authorities, such as Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. They don&rsquo;t like that, though, because it means there are still parts of the internet and types of records that they aren&rsquo;t (legally) allowed to add to the dragnet.</i></p><p><i>CISA changes that. CISA allows private companies to immediately share a perfect record of your private activities the instant you click a link, log in, make a purchase, and so on &ndash; and the government with reward for doing it by granting them a special form of legal immunity for their cooperation.”</i></p></blockquote><p>The former NSA contractor also <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/658772744780316672" target="_blank"><b>took to twitter</b></a> to encourage his 1.5 million followers to call their Senators to oppose the bill. Snowden’s comments come at the peak of a rising <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/131739253638/photos-anti-cisa-activists-spell-out-no-cisa" target="_blank"><b>wave of opposition</b></a> that has included dozens of civil society groups, security experts, and major tech companies including Apple, Twitter, Dropbox, Mozilla, and Wikipedia.</p><p>Fight for the Future and other groups have driven<b> <a href="http://faxbigbrother.com" target="_blank">millions of faxes</a></b>, hundreds of thousands of emails, and tens of thousands of phone calls in opposition of the bill. The hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StopCISA?src=hash" target="_blank"><b>#StopCISA</b></a> has been used more than <a href="http://topsy.com/s?q=%23StopCISA" target="_blank"><b>11,000 times</b></a> in the last week alone.</p><p>Snowden concluded his IAmA comments with a warning about the impact of CISA on Internet users’ trust in U.S. tech companies, echoing concerns from industry experts and privacy advocates:</p><blockquote><p><i>“This is a bill that will radically reshape the relationship between users and companies, because it undermines the core foundation of trust on the internet: that companies work for users rather than governments.”</i></p></blockquote><p><b>Fight for the Future campaign director Evan Greer said, </b>“This vote will go down in history as the moment that lawmakers decided not only what sort of Internet our children and our children’s children will have, but what sort of world they will live in. Every Senator who votes for CISA will be voting for a world without freedom of expression, a world without true democracy, a world without basic human rights. And they will be voting for their own removal from office, because the Internet will not forget which side of history they stood on.”</p><p>###</p><p>Fight for the Future is a grassroots advocacy group with more than 1.4 million members that fights to protect the Internet as a powerful platform for freedom of expression and social change.
