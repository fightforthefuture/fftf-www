        <span class="date">Posted 16:21 EDT on September 9, 2016</span>


        <p><b>For Immediate Release</b>: September 9, 2016<br/><b>Contact</b>: Christina DiPasquale, <a href="mailto:press@balestramedia.com" target="_blank">press@balestramedia.com</a></p><p>UPDATE: Fight for the Future has launched a petition supporting Chelsea in her hunger strike. <b><a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/stand-with-chelsea-manning-on-hunger-strike" target="_blank">See the petition here. </a></b></p><p>Today, after years of requesting the care she needs for gender dysphoria, Chelsea Manning has released a statement about the start of her hunger strike.</p><p>Chelsea is demanding written assurances from the Army she will receive all of the medically prescribed recommendations for her gender dysphoria and that the “high tech bullying” will stop. “High tech bullying,” is what Chelsea describes as “the constant, deliberate and overzealous administrative scrutiny by prison and military officials.”</p><p>Following her sentencing, Chelsea has respectfully requested that the US Government give her treatment for her gender dysphoria. Over a year later, Chelsea filed a lawsuit in September of 2014, where she sued the government to get a battery of treatments. As a result, she began hormone therapy in February of 2015.<br/><br/>However, the military has been making her cut her hair to the male length and grooming standards. As part of her treatment, her doctors recommended that she follow the military prison&rsquo;s female hair grooming standards. In September of 2015 she amended her lawsuit, asking that the government allow her to grow her hair. The government’s response in December 2015 was &ldquo;no.&rdquo; The case is still active before a DC District court judge.</p><p><b>Statement from Chelsea Manning:</b></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I need help. I am not getting any. I have asked for help time and time again for six years and through five separate confinement locations. My request has only been ignored, delayed, mocked, given trinkets and lip service by the prison, the military, and this administration.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need help. I needed help earlier this year. I was driven to suicide by the lack of care for my gender dysphoria that I have been desperate for. I didn&rsquo;t get any. I still haven&rsquo;t gotten any.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I needed help. Yet, instead I am now being punished for surviving my attempt. When I was a child, my father would beat me repeatedly for simply not being masculine enough. I was told to stop crying—to &quot;suck it up.&rdquo; But, I couldn&rsquo;t stop crying. The pain just got worse and worse. Until finally, I just couldn&rsquo;t take the pain anymore.&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;I needed help, but no one came then. No one is coming now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Today, I have decided that I am no longer going to be bullied by this prison—or by anyone within the U.S. government. I have asked for nothing but the dignity and respect—that I once actually believed would be provided for—afforded to any living human being.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not believe that this should be dependent on any arbitrary factors—whether you are cisgender or transgender; service member or civilian, citizen or non-citizen. In response to virtually every request, I have been granted limited, if any, dignity and respect—just more pain and anguish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am no longer asking. Now, I am demanding. As of 12:01 am Central Daylight Time on September 9, 2016, and until I am given minimum standards of dignity, respect, and humanity, I shall—refuse to voluntarily cut or shorten my hair in any way; consume any food or drink voluntarily, except for water and currently prescribed medications; and comply with all rules, regulations, laws, and orders that are not related to the two things I have mentioned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is a peaceful act. I intend to keep it as peaceful and non-violent, on my end, as possible. Any physical harm that should come to me at the hands of military or civilian staff will be unnecessary and vindictive. I will not physically resist or in any way harm another person. I have also submitted a &quot;do not resuscitate&rdquo; letter that is effective immediately. This shall include any attempts to forcibly cut or shorten my hair or to forcibly feed me by any medical or pseudo-medical means.&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;Until I am shown dignity and respect as a human again, I shall endure this pain before me. I am prepared for this mentally and emotionally. I expect that this ordeal will last for a long time. Quite possibly until my permanent incapacitation or death. I am ready for this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need help. Please, give me help.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>###</p>

Upcoming stops include San Francisco this Friday at an event featuring revolutionary hip hop legends Dead Prez, followed by stops in Toronto, Boston, and Washington, DC. High profile participants in the tour have included Rage Against the Machine / Prophets of Rage guitarist Tom Morello, popular punk band Anti-Flag, golden globe nominated actress Evangeline Lilly, and more.</p><p>“Artists have a very special place because we have a platform we can voice the struggle. We can voice the people that dedicate their lives to the struggle. We can voice the people that’s on the front lines,” <b>says hip hop legend Talib Kweli during his performance.</b></p><p>“As indigenous people, we’re kind of like the canaries in the coal mine. When there is environmental destruction, when there are corporations that are coming after our natural resources, as indigenous people we’re usually the ones on the front lines,” <b>Jeneda Benally of the Navajo punk band Sihasin explains in her interview. Her brother, Clayson Benally, added,</b> “When you give corporations total authority and power to change laws, that’s going too far. When they first come to strip away our rights, who’s next?”</p><p>“The TPP is a corporate protection agreement that increases the rights of corporations and supersedes existing laws in nations that bind themselves to the contract,” <b>says Hawaiian slack-guitar legend Makana in the video,</b> “it basically gives corporations a free pass to do whatever they want.”</p><p>“People are more willing to listen to a musician or a comedian or a poet because they appreciate other elements. They appreciate laughter, they appreciate the music, they appreciate how something is written,” <b>said comedian Hari Kondabolu,</b> “So if you’re somebody who’s already on board, it’s inspiring, right? People say you’re preaching to the choir, but sometimes the choir needs that. And then for folks who aren’t in the movement, who don’t see a lot of this stuff, to be in that space and actually question themselves in a way that they’re not being yelled at is another way to get the message.”</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s basically just a money grab,&rdquo; <b>said Danbert Nobacon of Chumbawamba, </b>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s transferring wealth from the taxpayers to corporations who are not even in the same country.&rdquo;</p><p>The TPP has little to do with trade, but instead grants multinational corporations extraordinary new powers to threaten jobs, the environment, affordable medicine, free speech, and food safety. The Rock Against the TPP tour brings together a broad coalition of supporters including digital rights groups, labor unions, environmental groups, and small businesses, and is sponsored by Backbone Campaign, Citizens Trade Campaign, Communications Workers of America (CWA), CREDO, Demand Progress, Friends of the Earth, the International Labor Rights Forum, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, SumOfUs, the Teamsters, and United Steelworkers.</p><p>The tour is organized by digital rights group Fight for the Future and Firebrand Records, the social justice fueled record label from Tom Morello and Ryan Harvey.

The roadshow has already drawn large crowds in Denver, San Diego, Seattle, and Portland.</p><p>“The Trans-Pacific Partnership is not about ‘free trade,’ it’s about corruption,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future and lead organizer of the tour, </b>“we’re harnessing the power of music and culture to sound the alarm about this corporate power grab and stop it in its tracks.”</p><p>The TPP has little to do with trade, but instead grants multinational corporations extraordinary new powers to threaten jobs, the environment, affordable medicine, free speech, and food safety. The Rock Against the TPP tour brings together a broad coalition of supporters including digital rights groups, labor unions, environmental groups, and small businesses, and is sponsored by Backbone Campaign, Citizens Trade Campaign, Communications Workers of America (CWA), CREDO, Demand Progress, Friends of the Earth, the International Labor Rights Forum, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, SumOfUs, the Teamsters, and United Steelworkers. Organizers plan to announce additional dates to the tour soon.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Additional performers at the September 9th event include SF indie rock darlings Built for the Sea, Taina Asili, Ryan Harvey, Evan Greer, bell’s roar, and local hip hop emcee Raw-G.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@fightfortheftr/photos-video-massive-crowd-giant-blimp-protests-trans-pacific-partnership-at-rock-against-the-1733f9ed1fa1#.xkq7oohiw" target="_blank"><b>SEE PHOTOS AND VIDEO AVAILABLE FOR USE BY PRESS HERE.</b></a></p><p>For Interviews with Artists or Organizers, please contact Evan Greer at <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a> or (978) 852-6457.</p><p>Learn more at <a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org/" target="_blank">https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org</a> </p><p># # #</p>
