        <span class="date">Posted 11:45 EST on February 5, 2015</span>


        <h2><i>Tumblr, Mozilla, BoingBoing, The Nation, AdaFruit, Daily Kos, CREDO, and more than 2,000 other websites participating in online protests this month. More than 5,000 people have signed up to tweet every day until the FCC’s vote, with a total social reach of more than 5 million people.</i></h2><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>February 5, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: <a href="mailto:evangreer@gmail.com" target="_blank">evangreer@gmail.com</a></p><p>THE INTERNET––Several of the world’s most popular web companies have re-affirmed their support for online free speech this week by encouraging their users to take action in coordination with the <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/countdown" target="_blank">Internet Countdown protest</a>, an effort between websites, Internet users, and grassroots groups to keep up a sustained barrage of phone calls and emails targeting lawmakers in Washington, DC between now and the FCC’s net neutrality vote on February 26th. To amplify the effort, more than 5,000 people used the Internet Countdown <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/countdown" target="_blank">twitter tool</a> to signed up to tweet every single day leading up to the decision, with a total social reach of more than 5 million each day.</p><p>The Countdown was launched on January 26th, exactly one month before the FCC’s vote, and has already attracted a number of prominent supporters, and more than 2,000 websites overall. Many websites are creating their own actions geared toward their user base, while dozens of others are using the Internet Countdown’s ready-made “widgets,” which allow any website owner, blogger, or Tumblr user to easily include a “countdown timer” on their site, literally counting down the seconds to the FCC’s vote. Clicking on the widget takes users to <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a>, the net neutrality hub site that was responsible for more than &frac14; of the overall comments that the FCC received during its comment periods.</p><p>This week, blogging platform Tumblr with its more than 220 million blogs unveiled a creative action at <a href="https://tumblr.com/everybodyontheinternet" target="_blank">https://tumblr.com/everybodyontheinternet</a> driving phone calls and emails to Congress in support of Title II net neutrality. On Wednesday, Mozilla, the makers of Firefox, began showing U.S. users of their popular web browser a message encouraging them to take action, and published <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/02/04/victory-for-net-neutrality-lets-take-it-across-the-finish-line/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>. Popular news site BoingBoing is showing users the countdown at the bottom of most articles sitewide. The Nation magazine <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/197193/weve-almost-won-fight-net-neutrality" target="_blank">also joined</a> this week, along with popular DIY electronics site AdaFruit. Social media app Thunderclap is displaying the countdown widget prominently on <a href="http://thunderclap.it" target="_blank">their frontpage</a>. </p><p>“Internet users around the world are celebrating the hard fought victory of getting the FCC chair to come out in support of real net neutrality through Title II reclassification, but they also know that the battle for the net is not over yet,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. She added, “We know that when the Internet comes together for the public interest, nothing is impossible. We will not accept defeat––the Internet will keep fighting until the FCC enacts strong, bright line rules that ban Cable companies from all forms of discrimination, blocking, or throttling of web content.</p><p>“These next few weeks are crucial,” said David Segal, Executive Director of Demand Progress. “Based on what we know now about Chairman Wheeler’s proposal to reclassify broadband Internet under Title II, we have never been closer 
to real net neutrality. But we can’t let up. We need to beat back any 
changes or loopholes in the rules that might weaken them, and we need to
 ensure that Congress does not interfere by advancing proposals that 
would undermine real net neutrality. <b>That’s
 why we’re urging the platforms that benefit from a free and open 
Internet to join us in the Internet Countdown over the next three weeks 
and finish what could be one of the most historic wins for the open Web 
that we’ve ever seen.”</b><br/></p><p>The Internet Countdown is being organized by Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, and Free Press, with the support of a broad <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/#teaminternet" target="_blank">#TeamInternet</a> coalition.</p><p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 20:16 EST on February 4, 2015</span>


        <figure class=""><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nj9y6ggVKX1ri3xd7.png?1492021787169"/></figure><p>Dear FFTF member,</p><p>We&rsquo;ve got chills as we write to you about this: we are on the brink of scoring the biggest victory in modern memory for the public and the Internet against some of the fiercest lobbies in the 
world.</p><p>The
 FCC Chairman just proposed rules for net neutrality, which will get 
voted on February 26th &ndash; they plan on reclassifying Comcast, Verizon, 
AT&amp;T, all telecom as a&hellip; Title II. Common. Carrier&hellip; meaning we keep the Internet equal for all.</p><p>Dollar for dollar, this is the biggest win against entrenched corruption and million dollar lobbyists in recent memory. No matter what happens next, this is a watershed moment for free speech. </p><p><b><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=titleiidonatelongversion" target="_blank">We can celebrate soon, but first we have to finish the fight. Will you chip in?<br/></a></b><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=titleiidonatelongversion" target="_blank"><br/></a>But,
 it&rsquo;s also true we still have three weeks to go before these rules get 
voted on. Almost anything can happen in that time, and the details of 
the rules matter so much. We know our opponents in the Cable industry 
will use their exclusive access to the FCC and Congress to add loopholes
 and attack the process. This
 is our last moment to blow this fight out of the water and make it 
crystal clear that we will not let ANY loophole or monopoly behavior gut
 this historic win we&rsquo;ve fought so hard for. </p><p>Can
 you make an emergency donation to help ramp up a bring-it-home, 
all-hands-on-deck campaign to protect free speech for decades?</p><p><b><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=titleiidonatelongversion" target="_blank">Yes, I will gladly, triumphantly, or fiercely donate $10, 20, or $500 to win net neutrality right now.</a><br/></b></p><p>There&rsquo;s
 no doubt this is the moment we&rsquo;ve all been fighting for. The FCC vote 
for net neutrality &ndash; the most important vote of the FCC&rsquo;s entire 
history &ndash; was a year in the making (and a decade of groundwork) and the
 result of coming together around smart, strategic mobilization at the 
FCC, the halls of Congress, across the political spectrum and around the
 world. </p><p>But,
 the Cable lobby knows exactly what they&rsquo;re going to do about it and 
they are unrolling their plans as we speak. We don&rsquo;t know all the 
details, but we
 know they are putting everything they&rsquo;ve got into the next three weeks 
to mobilize the TV networks they own, the million dollar political lists
 they&rsquo;ve bought, and the politicians they gave campaign contributions to
 (especially the ones who are already pushing a bill that could derail 
the vote).</p><p>It
 will all come down to February 26th, when the FCC votes on their rules.
 We know we can beat them, but on that day we&rsquo;ll either have done 
everything we needed to do to win real net neutrality or we&rsquo;ll lose it 
for a long time. </p><p><b><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=titleiidonatelongversion" target="_blank">So, it&rsquo;s up to us to decide if we close the deal. And, we have only have three weeks to get your support and do it. </a><br/></b></p><p>First,
 we&rsquo;re going to generate a massive avalanche of public opposition to 
Cable&rsquo;s plans by creatively distributing a ticking vote-countdown clock 
all across the web on thousands of websites and social media accounts. 
We&rsquo;ll generate such a determined outpouring of support for real net 
neutrality rules that we&rsquo;ll resoundingly save the open Internet and make
 it so politically toxic for any member of Congress and any FCC 
commissioner to be on the wrong side of history. <br/></p><p>We
 moved mountains to get here. A year ago when net neutrality rules were 
struck down in court, Title II was off the table. We bravely came out 
for it when it was scary and built campaigns so the support would 
spread. No one expected us to set up camp outside the FCC offices for 10
 days. And, when we created the Internet Slowdown protest and made the 
spinning wheel of death the iconic emblem of Cable&rsquo;s plans, and with our
 partners, helped drive a historic 4 million comments, we created the 
turning point for net neutrality that changed everything. </p><p>While
 millions of dollars and a host of lobbyists are a stone&rsquo;s throw away 
from every Congressional office and FCC staffer, we defied all odds and 
are winning, not on their terms of corruption and DC lobbying, but on 
our own &ndash; the public banding together. Our fingerprints are all over 
these rules. We know exactly how to finish the job.  </p><p><b>Are we ready to make the FCC vote on net neutrality the biggest moment for you, me, and everyone else? Oh yes.  </b></p><p>All
 those sleepless nights. All that wrist pain. The rain and the cold 
streets. All of that has been worth it. And it&rsquo;s going to be worth going
 through it all again over the next three weeks.</p><p>It&rsquo;s
 been an overwhelming years worth of work. But we&rsquo;re not going to let up
 now.  We’ve come so far. Not long ago most people didn’t have a clue 
what net neutrality even was. Now, we&rsquo;re mobilized and ready. Can you 
make a donation to help finish the job and save the free and open 
Internet?</p><p><b><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=titleiidonatelongversion" target="_blank">Yes, I’ll make a donation.</a><br/></b></p><p>Please, please join us in winning!<br/>&mdash; Tiffiniy Cheng <br/>Fight for the Future<br/></p><p>P.S.
 This isn’t the end &ndash; it’s the beginning. 2015 will be the year that we
 define the future of the Internet. We’re ready to fight but we need 
help. <a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=titleiidonatelongversion" target="_blank">Want to support us? Donate $20 (or more) today!</a><br/></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:51 EST on February 3, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>Updated February 4th, 2015<br/><br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p><b>FCC move toward Title II net neutrality rules is a huge win for grassroots activists and Internet users</b></p><p>WASHINGTON, DC &ndash; Today, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/02/fcc-chairman-wheeler-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">officially announced </a>his move toward strong Title II net neutrality protections for both mobile and broadband. Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future, the digital rights group that has led the grassroots on this issue and created <b><a href="https://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a> </b>and the<a href="https://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank"> <b>Internet Slowdown</b></a> protest, issued the following statement: </p><blockquote>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be ramping up the pressure to make sure the details are right, but the significance of the FCC moving to use Title II rules to protect net neutrality is undeniable &ndash; it is an awe-inspiring, unprecedented victory for the public and the Internet freedom movement against DC’s fiercest lobbies.<br/><br/>Every Internet activist who has signed a petition, made a call, or showed up at a protest deserves to celebrate. It’s crucial that we keep the pressure on both the FCC and Congress to make sure they get the details right, but no matter what happens from here, we’ve already accomplished more than any pundit, lobbyist, or Cable CEO thought was possible.<br/><br/>We’re celebrating, but we will remain vigilant. Based on media reports, it sounds like the FCC may be trying one last time to leave a loophole open for Cable companies to charge interconnection fees.  By now the FCC should know better &ndash; the public is paying extremely close attention, and won&rsquo;t be fooled by anything less than the real thing.&rdquo;                     <br/></blockquote><p>Fight for the Future, a digital rights group best known for their role in the <a href="http://www.sopastrike.com/numbers/" target="_blank">massive protests against SOPA</a>, has been at the center of the net neutrality fight since last year, and were instrumental in rallying widespread support to get Title II onto the table at the FCC, pressuring the White House to publicly support it, and then bombarding Congress with phone calls and emails to keep them from derailing the process. Their latest campaign is the <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/countdown" target="_blank">Internet Countdown</a>, launched last week, which has already attracted thousands of Internet users and websites using innovative “countdown” tools to broadcast messages every day until the FCC’s vote on February 26th. There are several high profile announcements related to the Countdown coming later this week.</p><p><b>Here are some highlights from net neutrality campaigns spearheaded by Fight for the Future:</b></p><p>-We worked with PopularResistance.org to organize the <b><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank">Occupy the FCC</a> </b>encampment, where activists camped outside the FCC for 10 days leading up to the initial release of the proposed rules. This was widely credited with making “Title II” a household name and getting it onto the table at the FCC.</p><p>-With our partners Demand Progress and Free Press we launched <b><a href="https://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a>,</b> which has become a central clearinghouse for net neutrality action and information, has been shared hundreds of thousands of times, and has attracted a wide coalition of Title II supporting <b><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/#teaminternet" target="_blank">#TeamInternet</a></b> organizations and tech companies including Tumblr, Kickstarter, Mozilla, reddit, Etsy, and Imgur.</p><p>-More than 40,000 websites joined us to support Title II during the September 10th<b> <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown protest</a>. </b>In a single day we drove more than 770,000 comments to the FCC and hundreds of thousands of phone calls and emails to Congress. </p><p>-When the FCC leaked a so-called Hybrid proposal, we organized <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/102005857218/net-neutrality-protests-sweep-the-u-s-after-fcc" target="_blank">nationwide <b>Emergency Protests</b></a><b>,</b> including one on the <b><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/11/07/protestors-descend-on-the-white-house-over-the-future-of-the-internet/" target="_blank">White House lawn</a>, </b>quickly sending the FCC back to the drawing board (eventually to write a full Title II rule.)</p><p>-We’ve driven more than <b><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/104245377138/press-release-net-neutrality-activists-give-the" target="_blank">55,000 phone calls</a> </b>to the FCC through our tool at <b><a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank">CallTheFCC.com</a>,</b> which circumvents the FCC switchboard to connect concerned Internet users directly with FCC employees.</p><p>-We delivered <b><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/101432363898/press-release-fight-for-the-future-delivers" target="_blank">more than 75,000 signatures</a></b> to the White House and ran <a href="http://www.obamasinternet.com/" target="_blank">a <b>series</b></a><b> </b>of public facing<b> <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/obama/" target="_blank">campaigns</a> </b>demanding that President Obama break his silence on net neutrality and speak out in favor of Title II reclassification.
