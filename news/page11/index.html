The event will kick off the <b>Rock Against the TPP </b>roadshow, a nationwide series of activism-fueled music events designed to raise awareness about the dangers of the toxic deal, which was negotiated in secret with hundreds of corporate advisors. Organized by Morello’s new label,<b> Firebrand Records</b> and digital rights group <b>Fight for the Future</b>, other stops on the tour feature well-known performers like <b>Talib Kweli</b> and <b>Jolie Holland</b>. The TPP has little to do with trade, but would provide multinational corporations with new rights and powers that threaten good paying jobs, Internet freedom, the environment, access to medicine, and food safety.</p><p><b>See a short video about the tour here: <a href="https://youtu.be/jKGRYypHogo" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/jKGRYypHogo</a> </b></p><p><b>See a full lineup and Rock Against the TPP tour dates here: <a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org/" target="_blank">RockAgainstTheTPP.org</a></b></p><p>Following the kick-off event in Denver this Saturday, the tour’s organizers have revealed three additional stops in San Diego, Seattle, and Portland, OR, with more dates to be announced.</p><p>“Working people everywhere have had enough,” <b>said Tom Morello, </b>“The TPP is nothing short of a corporate takeover of our democracy. That’s why people are rising up to stop it. Corporate lobbyists want to sneak the TPP through Congress quietly; that means it’s time for us to get loud.”</p><p>“This fight against the TPP is not about right and left, it’s about right and wrong,” <b>said Evangeline Lilly,</b> “Whatever you’re passionate about, whether it’s human rights, internet freedom, climate change, or food safety, the TPP is a bad deal for humanity, and a threat to the future of democracy. The more people learn about the TPP, the less they like it. It’s our responsibility to sound the alarm, before it’s too late.”</p><p>The<b> <a href="http://rockagainstthetpp.org/" target="_blank">Rock Against the TPP</a> </b>Tour is being organized by <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, the viral Internet freedom group best known for organizing the largest online protests in history against online censorship and in favor of free speech and privacy. <a href="http://firebrandrecords.com/" target="_blank">Firebrand Records</a>, the new social justice infused record label co-founded by Tom Morello and Ryan Harvey, is acting as the tour’s artistic partner. The roadshow is sponsored and co-organized by a diverse coalition of groups fighting against the corporate power grab that is the TPP, including Backbone Campaign, Citizens Trade Campaign, Communications Workers of America, CREDO, Demand Progress, Friends of the Earth, the International Labor Rights Forum, Private Internet Access, Public Citizen, the Sierra Club, SumOfUs, and the Teamsters. More than 30 organizations have endorsed the effort, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, National Nurses United, and the International Brotherhood of Carpenters.</p><p>Additional performers for the Denver kick-off include Firebrand Records artists <a href="http://ryanharveymusic.com/" target="_blank">Ryan Harvey</a>, <a href="http://www.liarose.com/" target="_blank">Lia Rose</a>, and <a href="http://sonofnun.net/" target="_blank">Son of Nun</a>, Puerto Rican vocalist <a href="http://tainaasili.com/" target="_blank">Taina Asili</a>, and riot-folk singer / Fight for the Future campaign director <a href="http://evangreer.org/" target="_blank">Evan Greer</a>, the tour’s lead organizer. Speakers from a broad coalition of local and national organizations opposing the TPP will address the crowd, explaining the many dangers posed by the agreement.</p><p>“The TPP is not a trade deal, it’s a corporate coup––an attack on the future of democracy and free speech,” said Evan Greer, “people from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly oppose it, and we’re going to fight not only to stop the TPP, but to make sure that decisions that affect all of us are never made behind closed doors in the future.”</p><p>###</p><p><b>Rock Against the TPP Tour dates</b></p><p>See full lineups at <a href="http://rockagainstthetpp.org/" target="_blank">RockAgainstTheTPP.org</a></p><p><b>July 23: </b>Denver, CO w/ Tom Morello, Evangeline Lilly, Anti-Flag, Downtown Boys</p><p><b>July 30:</b> San Diego, CA w/ Jolie Holland, Evangeline Lilly, Emma’s Revolution, Bonfire Madigan</p><p><b>August 19: </b>Seattle, WA w/ Talib Kweli, Evangeline Lilly, Anti-Flag, Downtown Boys</p><p><b>August 20:</b> Portland, OR w/ Anti-Flag, Evangeline Lilly, Downtown Boys + more TBA</p><p>Additional dates TBA.<br/><br/><b>About Tom Morello: </b>Incendiary rock guitarist and acoustic troubadour Tom Morello, known for his innovative guitar solos and thunderous chords, is a groundbreaking artist whether in his solo career or as an original member of the rock bands Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, two acts responsible for multiple Grammy Awards and a combined 30 million albums sold worldwide. He’s released four solo albums as The Nightwatchman and formed the band Street Sweeper Social Club with Boots Riley of The Coup in 2009. Morello has also been recognized by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the “100 Greatest Guitar Players of All-Time (#26).” Morello has produced or collaborated with artists of diverse genres including WuTang Clan, Johnny Cash, Tool, John Fogerty, Anti-Flag, Public Enemy, Joe Strummer, Crystal Method, Calle 13, Dave Mathews Band, Johnny Cash, Linkin Park, Travis Barker and Pete Seeger. In addition, he joined Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band for their 2014 world tour in support of Springsteen’s studio album High Hopes (Columbia Records) on which Morello is featured on eight tracks.  Most recently, Morello has joined forces with fellow Rage Against The Machine bandmates Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk, as well as Cypress Hill’s B-Real and Public Enemy’s Chuck D and DJ Lord to form the band Prophets of Rage. The group came together as a politically charged response to 2016’s tumultuous election year and after three sold-out club shows announced the launch of a 35-city trek across North America this summer.</p><p><b>About Evangeline Lilly:</b> Evangeline Lilly is an actress best known for her role as Kate Austen in LOST and films including The Hurt Locker, Real Steel, The Hobbit and Ant-Man. Evangeline is also a cross-genre writer, who writes for multiple demographics, and is a published author of her children&rsquo;s book series, The Squickerwonkers. With a background in International Relations and Political Science, Evangeline has long held a passion for social justice and is a strong advocate for Fight for the Future - and for democracy.</p><p><b>About Anti-Flag</b> (performing an acoustic set): After more than 20 years writing smash hits about smashing the state, ANTI-FLAG has cemented themselves as the premiere political punk band around with an unparalleled ability to write high-energy, riffy, fist-pumping, sing-along anthems that never lose sight of the band’s anti-war, anti-imperialism, pro human rights ethos.  Equal parts circle pit and picket line, their blistering and earnest live show brings a sense of community to the stage that unites people of all backgrounds and struggles.</p><p><b>About the Flobots:</b> Denver, Colorado’s revolutionary hip-hop act Flobots bring it on real with their signature anthems dedicated to creating a better world. Since forming in 2005, Flobots have released three full length albums, toured throughout the US and Europe, and appeared on late night programs including The Tonight Show and Late Night. Flobots are internationally known for their 2008 platinum single “Handlebars” and widely recognized for using their music as an inspiration for social change.</p><p><b>About Downtown Boys: </b>Downtown Boys are a bilingual political sax punk party from Providence, Rhode Island in the northeast United States. Rolling Stone called them &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Most Exciting Punk Band&rdquo; and NME has declared them a Band to Watch in 2016. They write songs about smashing the prison-industrial complex, racism, queerphobia, capitalism, fascism, boredom, and all things people tell us that try to close our minds, eyes, and hearts. The band is known for their live performances, which are equal parts punk show, political rally, and religious revival. Frontwoman Victoria Ruiz delivers moving speeches between songs, working the crowd into an angry but hopeful frenzy. The songs themselves are delivered with an earnestness, fun, and intensity that&rsquo;s stunned audiences on their tours throughout North America.</p><p><b>About Fight for the Future:</b> Fight for the Future is a non-profit with more than 1 million members dedicated to defending and expanding the Internet’s transformative power for good. They’re best known for their vibrant, viral campaigns, and for organizing the largest online protests in history against SOPA, for net neutrality, and against mass surveillance. Last year, the group drove tens of thousands of phone calls and emails to Congress opposing the TPP through its <a href="http://stopfasttrack.com/" target="_blank">StopFastTrack.com</a> coalition page. They also made headlines for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDKzwB8GhN0" target="_blank">flying a 30 foot blimp</a> opposing the TPP over Senator Ron Wyden’s town hall meetings in Oregon. Fight for the Future conceived of the Rock Against the TPP effort, and are leading the organizing of the tour, with support from a wide range of public interest groups, labor unions, and grassroots volunteers.</p><p><b>About Firebrand Records: </b>Firebrand is a bold new project from Ryan Harvey (Riot-Folk) and Tom Morello (Rage Against The Machine, Audioslave, Prophets of Rage) dedicated to the global release and distribution of radical, socially conscious music. In recent years, people around the world have surprised each other with their courage, strength, and willingness to stand against injustice, militarism, and corruption. And where there has been protest, there has been music. Born from these times, Firebrand gives a platform for such voices. We know that music alone does not change the world, but we recognize that it is an integral part of the movements that do.</p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2016-07-14-we-have-four-days-to-save-the-open-internet-in/">“We have four days to save the open Internet in Europe.” An open letter by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Professor Larry Lessig, and Professor Barbara van Schewick</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 15:30 EDT on July 14, 2016</span>


        <p>Today, the inventor of the Word Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, Larry 
Lessig, and Barbara van Schewick published an open letter to European 
citizens, law makers and regulators. Entitled “We have four days to save
 the open Internet in Europe,” the letter:</p><ul><li>urges regulators to make changes in four key areas to secure meaningful net neutrality in Europe; and</li><li>urges Europeans to take action by participating in the public consultation.</li></ul><p>Four
 days before the end of the public consultation on net neutrality in 
Europe, the letter could be a game-changer in the debate over the future
 of the Internet in Europe.</p><p>The letter is available here: <a href="http://webfoundation.org/2016/07/four-days-to-save-the-open-internet-in-europe-an-open-letter/" target="_blank">http://webfoundation.org/2016/07/four-days-to-save-the-open-internet-in-europe-an-open-letter/</a></p><h2>What’s happening &amp; why it matters:<br/></h2><p>Last
 fall, the European Union adopted a net neutrality law that was widely 
viewed as the end of net neutrality in Europe. Now regulators are 
writing guidelines to determine how the law will be applied in practice.
 <b>What most people don’t know: These guidelines could still secure net
 neutrality in Europe — if regulators use them to close potential 
loopholes in the law. </b></p><p>Until July 18, the public has an 
opportunity to comment on the draft guidelines in a public consultation.
 While the draft guidelines are promising, they need to be improved in 
four key areas, described in the letter, to provide meaningful net 
neutrality in Europe. The letter urges regulators to make these changes.
 </p><p><b>So far, the consultation has received little public attention. That’s a big problem.</b>
 The carriers are lobbying furiously to water down the guidelines. Their
 latest move: Last Wednesday, the 17 largest telecom companies in Europe
 <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/7/10/12139700/telecom-companies-5g-service-european-union-net-neutrality" target="_blank">threatened not to invest</a>
 in the next generation of 5G mobile networks unless regulators water 
down the guidelines. Their efforts are getting traction: EU commissioner
 Oettinger, the commissioner in charge of this proceeding, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?action=display&amp;doc_id=16579" target="_blank">published</a> the manifesto on the Commission’s website and <a href="https://twitter.com/GOettingerEU/status/751299158590550017" target="_blank">lauded it on Twitter</a>.</p><p><b>Unless
 people speak up now, regulators will not be able to withstand this 
pressure and we will lose net neutrality in Europe after all.</b> In 
India and the United States, millions of people participated in the 
public consultations on net neutrality. Their voices were a key factor 
that motivated regulators to adopt strong net neutrality rules in these 
countries.</p><h2>Key quotes from the letter: </h2><p> “Network 
neutrality for hundreds of millions of Europeans is within our grasp. 
Securing this is essential to preserve the open Internet as a driver for
 economic growth and social progress. But the public needs to tell 
regulators <i><b>now</b></i> to strengthen safeguards, and not cave in to telecommunications carriers’ manipulative tactics.” </p><p>
 “We – the ordinary users of the Internet – don’t have expensive 
lobbyists. But we have millions of people – everyday Europeans, 
startups, investors, small businesses, activists, NGOs, bloggers, 
independent artists – who have experienced the power of the open 
Internet first hand and want to protect it.” </p><p>“The Internet has 
become the critical infrastructure of our time – for our daily life, for
 our economy, for our democracy. Strong guidelines will protect the 
future of competition, innovation, and creative expression in Europe, 
enhancing Europe’s ability to lead in the digital economy. They will 
ensure that every European, no matter the color of their skin or the 
size of their wallets, has an equal chance to innovate, compete, speak, 
organize, and connect online.”</p><p>“There are four areas that regulators need to get right to secure meaningful net neutrality in Europe:<br/>1. <i>Ban Fast Lanes</i>:
 Regulators need to close a loophole that could allow carriers to offer 
special “fast lanes” to normal websites and applications for a fee.<br/>2. <i>Ban Zero-rating</i>: Regulators need to ban harmful forms of zero-rating.<br/>3. <i>Ban Discrimination</i>: Regulators need to prevent carriers from discriminating among classes of traffic to manage their networks.<br/>4. <i>Protect Internet Access</i>: Regulators need to prohibit new “specialized” services from taking over bandwidth that people bought to access the Internet.” </p><p>“Telecom
 regulators can still protect net neutrality in Europe – if they make 
the key changes described above. We urge regulators to make these 
changes. And we urge you to contact those regulators before July 18th 
and let them know the public supports strong network neutrality 
guidelines.“</p><p>“We have four days to save the open Internet in Europe. Let’s use them.”</p><p>You

 Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web. He founded and 
directs the World Wide Web Consortium, the forum for technical 
development of the Web, and the World Wide Web Foundation, which works 
to ensure that the World Wide Web serves humanity. His twitter handle is
 @timberners_lee.</p><p>Larry Lessig, Professor of Law at Harvard Law 
School, was the first to write about the concept of net neutrality even 
before the term was coined. His research, testimony, and advocacy on net
 neutrality laid the foundation for net neutrality debates around the 
world. His book “Code and other laws of cyberspace” revolutionized the 
field of Internet policy. His twitter handle is @lessig.</p><p>Barbara 
van Schewick, Professor of Law and (by courtesy) Electrical Engineering 
at Stanford University, is a leading expert on net neutrality. Her work 
on net neutrality has influenced regulatory proceedings on net 
neutrality in the US, India, South America, and Europe. The FCC’s Open 
Internet Orders in 2010 and 2015, which adopted net neutrality rules for
 the US, relied heavily on her work. Last year, Slate put her at the top
 of the list of “<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/09/22/barbara_van_schewick_susan_crawford_and_other_women_who_won_net_neutrality.html" target="_blank">Women who won net neutrality</a>” in the US.

Though she would have preferred to keep her private medical information private, and instead focus on her recovery, the government’s gross breach of confidentiality in disclosing her personal health information to the media has created the very real concern that they may continue their unauthorized release of information about her publicly without warning. Due to these circumstances, Chelsea Manning requested that we communicate with the media and her friends and supporters on her behalf.</p><p>“Last week, Chelsea made a decision to end her life. Her attempt to take her own life was unsuccessful. She knows that people have questions about how she is doing and she wants everyone to know that she remains under close observation by the prison and expects to remain on this status for the next several weeks. For us, hearing Chelsea’s voice after learning that she had attempted to take her life last week was incredibly emotional. She is someone who has fought so hard for so many issues we care about and we are honored to fight for her freedom and medical care.”</p><p>###</p><p><i>Fight for the Future is a digital rights group that has been supporting Chelsea Manning while in prison. This press release was posted with the approval of her attorneys. </i></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2016-07-11-here-are-the-key-senators-on-mccain-4787/">The Senate votes this week on whether to give the FBI warrantless access to your browsing history.</a></h1>

        <h2 id="here-are-the-key-senators-that-could-swing-the-vote-either-way">Here are the key senators that could swing the vote either way.</h2>

 <p>A couple of weeks ago, the Senate tried to sneak a rider onto a spending bill that would give the FBI sweeping new surveillance authority, including warrantless access to browsing history (obtained from ISPs). This measure failed by one vote after thousands of people called their senators using a phone tool we set up at www.decidethefuture.org and 1-919-FREEDOM.</p>

 <p>Now, Republican leadership is planning to re-introduce the measure (McCain Amendment 4787) and do a re-vote this week. Even though we won the first time, the razor-thin margin means this upcoming vote could really go either way. It all boils down to a few key senators who are undecided or likely to change their minds. Here’s what we know so far:</p>
