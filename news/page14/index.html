        <span class="date">Posted 13:44 EDT on July 28, 2015</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="384" data-orig-width="400"><img data-orig-height="384" data-orig-width="400" alt="image" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ns7l8xxDME1s45cnp_540.jpg"/></figure><h2><b>This bill must be rejected by the Senate and President Obama should threaten to veto! <a href="https://www.faxbigbrother.com/" target="_blank">Take action here to #StopCISA</a></b><br/></h2><p><i>Cross-posted from <a href="http://www.congressionaldish.com/heres-how-cisa-helps-the-nsa-scrape-the-internet-backbone-to-read-your-emails-at-will/#more-1792" target="_blank">Congressional Dish</a>:</i><br/></p><p>The National Security Agency is sitting on a new surveillance 
apparatus, awaiting congressional action to help them begin collecting a
 massive amount of new data on people in the U.S. that they can view and
 share without a warrant.</p><p>According to<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/04/us/document-cyber-surveillance-documents.html" target="_blank"> documents</a>
 made available to the press by Edward Snowden, in 2012 the Department 
of Justice secretly approved the NSA to begin using cyber threat 
indicators as selector terms for conducting “upstream” surveillance, a 
technique that involves the use of interception equipment to pull 
information directly from the switches and cables that make up the 
Internet. It’s likely, however, that the NSA hasn’t had a lot of cyber 
threat information to work with up to this point; most of that 
information is held by private companies.</p><p>Now it appears that Congress may be ready to help the NSA get the 
information they need to finally crank up their cybersecurity 
surveillance system. The Senate this week is expected to take up a bill,
 the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754/text" target="_blank"> Cyber Information Sharing Act</a>
 (CISA, formerly known as CISPA), that would incentivize companies to liberally share “cyber 
threat indicators” with the Department of Homeland Security by granting 
them<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754/text#toc-idc6842ed051194cfda77e2d250867c1f7" target="_blank"> legal immunity</a> from any surveillance laws when they do so.</p><p>The companies would be allowed to leave their users’ personal details
 in the information they give to the government unless they 
affirmatively know that it is not directly related to a threat, and the 
DHS would be required to share all of the information with the NSA and 
other federal agencies.</p><p>But that’s just the beginning of how CISA would massively violate privacy.</p><p>Any information shared with the government under CISA could be<a href="http://webpolicy.org/2015/06/04/nsa-cybersecurity/#nsa_cybersecurity_fn_8" target="_blank"> used to turn on the NSA’s latent cybersecurity surveillance powers</a>.
 As revealed by the Snowden documents, cyber threat indicators can be 
used by the NSA as selectors to target the warrantless interception and 
collection of information from the Internet backbone. These selectors — 
things like email address, IP addresses, ranges of IP addresses, phone 
numbers, or strings of computer code — are used as filters to select and
 extract data from Internet traffic.</p><p>Importantly, any “incidental” data that is picked up along the way 
that is not directly related to the threat, including any and all 
personal data that is hacked or targeted as part of the cyber threat, 
can be indefinitely retained by the NSA. This could be a massive amount 
of data if a threat involves a company like Google, Bank of America, or 
AT&amp;T.</p><p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1881a" target="_blank">Section 702</a>
 of the FISA Amendments Act, which the government uses to authorize its 
upstream collection programs, allows the NSA to retain, share, and use 
information about U.S. persons related to criminal investigations, 
including (but not limited to) those involving cybersecurity crimes.</p><p>The NSA, FBI, and other law enforcement entities are allowed to query
 the databases that are assembled under Section 702 at will using U.S. 
persons identifiers (e.g. email addresses and phone numbers of people 
who live in the U.S.) to access communications that can be used in 
criminal investigations. This is the warrantless process that has become
 known as the “backdoor search loophole.” All of this can be done 
without a warrant under Section 702 because that law  was supposed to 
only be used to investigate foreign suspects.</p><p>There’s no way to know exactly how much CISA will expand the NSA’s 
ability to collect and query data on Americans’ communications, but the 
leaked documents suggest that the cyber threats shared under CISA will 
help them add a major new plank to their activities that they have 
lobbying for for years. The broad legal immunity provisions in CISA 
should help the NSA get a huge amount information to input into the 
system from a wide range of data-rich industries, including insurers, 
banks, casinos, telecoms, hospitals, airlines, and more that have 
already announced their<a href="http://maplight.org/us-congress/bill/114-s-754/6636586/total-contributions" target="_blank"> support</a> for the bill.</p>

The coalition has also built a tool that automatically turns the contents every tweet with the hashtag #FaxBigBrother into a fax sent to the Senate. </p><p>The week of action launched yesterday, and <b>already more than 6 MILLION faxes are queued up to flood fax machines on Capitol Hill.</b> Each fax is sent to all 100 members of the Senate. .</p><p>“Cybersecurity experts agree that CISA won’t stop cyberattacks like the OPM hacks, but Congress is stuck in 1984 and clearly doesn’t understand modern technology,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, the group that developed the faxing tool,</b> “They’ve received millions of emails and phone calls from concerned citizens opposing bills like CISA that grant companies sweeping legal immunity to share our private data with the government; maybe using technology as outdated as their thinking will help them finally get the message.”</p><p>“CISA is a mass surveillance bill dressed up as a cybersecurity bill,” <b>added Fight for the Future CTO Jeff Lyon,</b> “It’s a blatant end-run around the Constitution and essentially legalizes all forms of government and corporate spying, putting giant companies like Facebook and Google above the law and allowing them to do almost anything they want with our personal information.”</p><p>The week of action, entitled “Operation: Fax Big Brother,” is being organized by Fight for the Future, Access, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, with support from more than a dozen groups from both the left and the right including the ACLU, American Library Association, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Freedom of the Press Foundation, Constitution Project. Association of Research Libraries, Niskanen Center, Free Press, The X-Lab, Sunlight Foundation, and Media Alliance.</p><p>The technology behind the #FaxBigBrother tool was developed by Jeff Lyon. Using a dedicated server and phone lines running out of his attic, the Fax Robot system is capable of continuously flooding Congress with thousands of faxes.</p><p>###</p><p><i>Fight for the Future is a digital rights group best known for organizing massive online protests against SOPA and for net neutrality.

        <span class="date">Posted 14:00 EDT on June 23, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: June 23, 2015<br/>Contact: Holmes Wilson, 614-465-6371, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p><b>WASHINGTON, DC —</b> Moments ago, the U.S. Senate voted to advance Fast Track Trade Promotion Authority. The 60-37 motion sets up a final vote tomorrow that is almost certain to pass, which will then send the bill to President Obama’s desk to become law. Fast Track makes it virtually certain that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), and other secret trade deals will become law.</p><p>Fight for the Future, an Internet-freedom nonprofit best known for their role organizing massive online protests around SOPA, online privacy, and net neutrality, issued the following statement, which can be attributed to Holmes Wilson, Director of Fight for the Future.</p><blockquote><p><i>“Today, the Senate chose to completely ignore the public and advance Fast Track anyway. People from across the political spectrum spoke out in overwhelming numbers against Fast Track because they know that when the government acts in secret, with only corporate lobbyists to advise them, the results are always terrible.”</i></p><p><i>“These trade deals are written by government bureaucrats and corporate lobbyists behind closed doors, and now neither Congress nor the the public will have any meaningful ability to debate them. A simple yes or no vote with 30 days of review after a multi-year secret negotiation process isn’t public oversight– it’s a farce.”</i></p><p><i>“These secret deals are about getting big, entrenched industries everything they want that they couldn’t get passed in the open. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is an MPAA lobbyist’s dream bill for exporting America’s worst copyright laws to the rest of the world, filled with bits and pieces of all the bills that they couldn’t get passed in Congress.”</i></p><p><i>“We’re disappointed. We’d hoped that 2015 would be the year when we’d finally stop the lobbyists behind SOPA and PIPA from passing Internet policy in secret, through trade deals. They won this round, but the loophole that trade agreements give lobbying groups for passing policy in secret remains an insane insult to democracy. We’ll close it someday.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Fight for the Future is a digital rights nonprofit that has driven more than 170,000 emails and more than 18,000 phone calls to Congress opposing Fast Track in the last two months, rallied more than 7,500 websites for an online protest, and helped coordinate a letter to Congress from more than 250 tech companies expressing transparency and tech related concerns about Fast Track legislation.</p><p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 14:20 EDT on June 12, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, June 12, 2015<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>WASHINGTON, DC—Moments ago, the U.S. House of Representatives dealt a blow to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), and other secret trade deals by overwhelmingly voting down a critical Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) provision linked to the fast track authority package. Under the rules for the fast track debate, the vote means that the current version of the “Fast Track” bill sent over by the Senate is dead, and it pushes future votes further into election season, putting the TPP and other secret agreements on shakier ground than ever before.</p><p><b></b></p><p>The House may reconsider the TAA vote next week in attempt to salvage the badly beaten Fast Track package, but a growing and politically diverse coalition stands ready to fight it going forward if necessary.</p><p><a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, an Internet-freedom nonprofit best known for their role organizing massive online protests around SOPA, online privacy, and net neutrality, issued the following statement, which can be attributed to campaign director, Evan Greer:</p><blockquote><p><i>“Today, the Internet wins again. The public has resoundingly rejected every attempt to limit our online freedom from SOPA to attacks on net neutrality. Today, Internet users around the world made their voices heard when Congress rejected an utterly broken and outdated trade negotiations process that has been abused for far too long to advance the interests of the largest industries at the expense of innovation and basic human rights.</i></p><p><i>Every month pro-Fast Track members of Congress have claimed that they would pass it and every month the overwhelming resistance from the public has forced them to abandon or delay their plans at the last minute. Trade Promotion Authority legislation will put us on a Fast Track to Internet censorship and decreased privacy, and would allow bureaucrats and lobbyists to make crucial decisions that impact the future of the Web in total secrecy. </i></p><p><i>Lobbyists from the MPAA and RIAA, the same folks that brought us Internet censorship bills like SOPA and PIPA and terrible trade agreements like ACTA, thought that the closed-door Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations would be the perfect place for them to push through extreme copyright provisions that could be devastating for online free speech and the startup economy.</i></p><p><i>Today, we can celebrate a victory over this secrecy, and prepare ourselves to continue fighting for a world where decisions that impact the Web are made with transparency and accountability.&ldquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>Fight for the Future is a digital rights nonprofit that has driven more than 130,000 emails and more than 15,000 phone calls to Congress in recent months, rallied more than 7,500 websites for an <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/internetvote" target="_blank">online protest</a>, and helped coordinate <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/20/hundreds-tech-companies-oppose-tpp-trade-agreement" target="_blank">a letter</a> to Congress from more than 250 tech companies expressing transparency and tech related concerns about Fast Track legislation. </p><p>The group made headlines in March when they <a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/wydenblimp/" target="_blank">flew a 30’ blimp</a> over several of Senator Ron Wyden’s town hall meetings calling for him to “Save the Internet” by opposing Fast Track for the TPP, and then <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/115053188968/internet-activists-call-out-ron-wyden-over-fast" target="_blank">parked a Jumbotron</a> on capitol hill to display <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=923903510963109" target="_blank">the viral video</a> they made about the stunt. More recently, Fight for the Future made a splash on the hill when they <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/121108152418/republican-house-members-receive-rubber-stamps" target="_blank">delivered actual rubber stamps</a> to every house Republican’s office with a mock letter from President Obama asking Congress to “please rubber stamp my secret trade agenda.”</p><p>Fight for the Future works to defend the Internet as a free and open platform for expression and creativity, and is best known for their role organizing the <a href="http://www.sopastrike.com/numbers" target="_blank">massive online protests</a> against SOPA, the <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a> for net neutrality, and the <a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">Reset The Net</a> campaign for online privacy, which was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/edward-snowden-privacy-reset-the-net" target="_blank">endorsed</a> by Edward Snowden. </p><p>###</p>
