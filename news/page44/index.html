      <h1><a href="/news/2014-06-04-press-release-edward-snowden-internets-largest">PRESS RELEASE: Edward Snowden, Internet's largest websites join Reset the Net</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 13:31 EDT on June 4, 2014</span>


        <p id="docs-internal-guid-1d9363a5-67d2-71bf-c9ac-4f7be6da18de"><span>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</span></p>
<p><span>Media Contact: Ellen Satterwhite<br/>Email: esatterwhite@glenechogroup.com<br/>Phone: (719) 963-2722</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Edward Snowden and Internet&rsquo;s largest websites join Fight for the Future campaign to “Reset the Net” against government mass surveillance</strong> </span></p>
<p><em>Companies, trade groups, consumer organizations and Internet users form growing backlash against government spying programs and move to directly block it on the Internet</em></p>
<p><span>June 5, 2014 &ndash; Fight for the Future and its partners launched Reset the Net today, a national backlash campaign comprised of internet users and tech companies who commit taking back their right to privacy and protecting the Internet by using NSA-resistant privacy tools on their devices, and to take their privacy back &ndash; one user, one cat video, one device at a time. Reset the Net demands that </span><span>web services take concrete steps to protect their users from government snooping, while encouraging the spread of free and open source privacy tools.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been one year since Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the U.S. government&rsquo;s abusive spying programs. In that time Congress and the Obama Administration have failed to protect our rights,&rdquo; said Tiffiniy Cheng, spokesperson for Fight for the Future. &ldquo;Now, they&rsquo;ve got a rebellion on their hands as tech companies and internet users work together to directly intervene in mass surveillance and block the NSA and its kind from the web.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Edward Snowden issued a <a href="http://resetthenet.tumblr.com/post/87793640365/edward-snowdens-statement-in-support-of-reset-the-net" target="_blank">statement</a> via his attorney supporting the Reset the Net campaign: </strong></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Today, we can begin the work of effectively shutting down the collection of our online communications&hellip;that’s why I’m asking you to join me on June 5th for Reset the Net, when people and companies all over the world will come together to implement the technological solutions that can put an end to the mass surveillance programs of any government. We have the technology, and adopting encryption is the first effective step that everyone can take to end mass surveillance&hellip;don’t ask for your privacy. Take it back.”</span></p>
<p><span>Cheng continued, &quot;In the last year the public has spoken: mass surveillance is illegitimate. It&rsquo;s fundamentally at odds with democracy. Governments that abuse the Internet to invade our privacy will lose their credibility in the eyes of the world&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span>Reset the Net is backed by some of the largest internet companies and advocacy organizations in the world who have committed to taking steps to protect internet users’ privacy, from reddit and Mozilla to Amnesty International and the ACLU, all calling for the integration of basic security features into internet services that will prevent their exploitation, and helping promote a </span><a href="http://pack.resetthenet.org" target="_blank"><span>Privacy Pack</span></a><span> with free, easy-to-use, open source software that all users can use to protect themselves. Internet giant </span><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/06/transparency-report-protecting-emails.html" target="_blank"><span>Google</span></a><span> made available the source code for End-to-End, a Chrome extension that provides encryption for both sides of an email exchange.</span></p>
<p><span>“Mass surveillance is not inevitable. We believe </span><span>we can make it too expensive and too difficult to bulk collect our data,”</span><span> said Cheng. “</span><span> Starting today, we will turn more and more parts of the Internet into places the NSA and other governments cannot see. Who in Congress is going to ask for more money to take away the human rights that citizens have taken back?&ldquo;</span></p>
<p><span>The Reset the Net website will allow users to pledge their support in trying and sharing privacy tools as well as provide resources that allow for end-to-end encryption of data.</span></p>

</li>
</ul><p><strong>Statements from participating companies and organizations supporting Reset the Net</strong></p>
<p><strong>Richard Kirkendall, CEO of Namecheap, said, </strong><span>“Namecheap has a long history of supporting privacy and freedom of expression online. We’ve always worked hard to preserve and protect our customers’ rights. So we’re thrilled to participate in resetting the net in this positive way,”</span></p>
<p><strong>Michael Kieschnick, CEO of CREDO Mobile, said, </strong><span>“It’s been an entire year since Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the NSA&rsquo;s unconstitutional and warrantless mass surveillance programs, but Congress and the president still have not reined in the NSA to stop these abuses. Until our government meaningfully reforms its surveillance programs to bring them in line with the 1st and 4th amendments, we will encourage users to adopt encryption tools to protect personal communications.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Erik Martin, General Manager of reddit, said,</strong> </span><span>&ldquo;The Internet is most powerful tool humans have ever had to connect people to information and connect them to each other. The Internet has so much potential to create good in the world and put a dent on some of the big problems in the world, and that&rsquo;s why people are so ferociously motivated to defend it. reddit couldn&rsquo;t operate in a world without freedom of expression, but that&rsquo;s the future that we face if we allow surveillance to continue unchecked. We are proud to have been an early supporter of Reset the Net, and we look forward to doing everything in our power as a company to encourage the use of privacy technology that protects Internet users&rsquo; human rights.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Lee of Private Internet Access said,</strong><span> &ldquo;Privacy is a fundamental human right. Unless we act now, we risk losing everything: our rights, our individuality, our freedom of speech. We have a rare opportunity to turn the tables and restore the Internet to the way it should be. Private Internet Access works every day to make the web a safer place for all, we&rsquo;re proud to help Reset the Net on June 5th.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Tracy Rosenberg, Executive Director of Media Alliance </strong><span><strong>said</strong> “The watering-down of the USA Freedom Act demonstrates that Internet citizens will have to take their online safety and security into their own hands. Reset The Net is a crucial first step in restoring the innovative and creative potential of the Internet.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Felicity Ruby, Internet Policy Director of Thoughtworks, said, </strong><span><strong>“</strong>Given the absence of meaningful government or industry reform one year after the shocking revelations of Edward Snowden, Internet users need to take their own privacy seriously. ThoughtWorks is committed to securing communications - both our own and those of our clients and the general public - from dragnet and illegitimate government mass surveillance and unfettered data mining for commercial purposes. To that end we have begun the development of a secure, encrypted email solution that will be open source software.”</span></p>
<p><strong><strong>Amie Stepanovich, Senior Policy Counsel of Access, said,</strong> </strong>&ldquo;Governments should not be able to treat the internet as a digital panopticon for untargeted, indiscriminate surveillance. One tool for us to prevent this from happening is wide scale adoption of encryption technologies. We applaud the many companies and individuals who are taking steps to cut off unauthorized access to user data, but we can and must do more. We must take back the internet, encrypt all the things, and stop mass surveillance.&rdquo;<strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ben Kroetz, Online Director of Greenpeace, said,</strong><span> &ldquo;Greenpeace has learned firsthand during the past 40 years that people cannot protect their right to a clean environment if our civil rights –  including the right to free association and the right to be free of unreasonable searches – are stripped away. A healthy democracy is necessary for a healthy environment, and democracy cannot thrive where a government illegally spies on its citizens as the NSA is doing now.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson, Executive Director of OpenMedia.org</strong><span><strong>, said:</strong> “At the end of the day, we’re going to have to create accountability for governments that are spying on their citizens. And it’s sad that people feel they need to route around what their government is doing - this shows just how far governments have grown out of touch with their citizens. It’s so important that people speak out in any way they can about surveillance, and using encryption technologies is one way to do that.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Ethan Oberman, CEO of SpiderOak </strong><span><strong>said</strong> “The Snowden revelations not only raised the level of awareness around privacy but also intrinsically changed the way people think about their online presence. It is wonderful that there is more awareness around this issue and even more wonderful to see the advancements that companies have made in the past year, especially around data encryption. However, privacy on the Internet has been a known problem for a long time, and the solution will not arrive overnight despite public outcries. We are starting to see a shift in the way companies handle user privacy but it will take a while before the Internet as a whole adapts to new privacy standards. In the end, everything evolves and so will our ability to use technology to ensure a greater level of privacy online. And the Snowden leak will forever be a turning point in the conversation and a catalyst around the cause.&ldquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>David Segal, Executive Director of Demand Progress, said, </strong><span>“Demand Progress is committed to fighting for legislative reforms to protect user privacy and our civil liberties. But until those reforms vest &ndash; or if they don&rsquo;t &ndash; the Internet is too important to leave unprotected. We are supporting Reset The Net in order to protect our rights to privacy and to free association. It&rsquo;s time to turn on encryption by default.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Kevin Bankston, Policy Director at Open Technology Institute, </strong><span><strong>said,</strong> &quot;The Open Technology Institute is excited to support Reset the Net and highlight the need for all of us – both individual internet users and the companies that serve them – to take full advantage of encryption and other security tools that can help protect our private data against snoops, spies, criminals and creeps.  Strong encryption tools are one of our best defenses against the sort of indiscriminate bulk surveillance that the Snowden revelations have revealed.”</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Josh Levy of Free Press said,</strong> “</span><span>Our right to free expression depends on access to open and secure communications networks. And the NSA&rsquo;s surveillance programs are some of the most serious attacks on these networks — and their users — we&rsquo;ve ever seen. Free Press is proud to have co-founded the StopWatching.Us coalition, which launched one year ago, to lead the fight to restore our rights to connect and communicate in private. Today we&rsquo;re supporting the Reset the Net effort by making a number of changes to our websites to protect users&rsquo; privacy, including the removal of all tracking cookies and beacons. We look forward to continuing the fight against mass surveillance in Congress, in the courts, online and in the streets.”</span></p>
<p><span><strong>John Sullivan, Executive Director, Free Software Foundation, said,</strong> </span><span>&quot;None of the companies or governments fighting to control the Internet treat your freedom and privacy as any priority. Maybe we can make them change over time, but today we can act without their permission to protect ourselves and our networks, using free software they don&rsquo;t control.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Joseph Lorenzo Hall, Chief Technologist at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology,</strong><span><strong> said,</strong> “Everyone, including app makers, websites, and the public, needs to practice good digital hygiene and take the right steps to protect personal security. Together, we can make it much harder to snoop on our lives online.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Ben Wizner, Director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project</strong><span><strong>, said,</strong> “Americans entrust the most intimate details of their lives to large technology and communications companies. For too long, these companies failed to secure their customers&rsquo; information, leaving it vulnerable to dragnet government surveillance. It&rsquo;s time for that to change. It&rsquo;s time to protect our data, to deploy best-practice security and privacy enhancing technologies, and to ensure that governments everywhere have to knock on the front door – with a court order – rather than sneak in the back door to steal our data.”</span></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2014-05-27-its-hard-to-ignore-millions-of-voices-calling-for">It's hard to ignore millions of voices calling for net neutrality -- but the FCC was doing a pretty good job of it until we showed up on their doorstep with tents.</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 17:07 EDT on May 27, 2014</span>


        <p><span><img alt="image" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n6av4kGZQL1qb05d0.jpg"/></span></p>
<p><span>Hey team,</span></p>
<p><span>Here&rsquo;s the latest. Three weeks ago, we organized <strong><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank">a game-changing encampment</a></strong> outside of the FCC building in DC to shine a spotlight on the agency&rsquo;s terrible plan to move ahead with a corrupt &ldquo;net neutrality&rdquo; proposal that could allow for Internet discrimination and censorship. </span></p>
<p><span>What started as a rag tag band of die-hard Internet freedom activists camped out on the FCC&rsquo;s doorstep with tents quickly blossomed into a full-on popular revolt against the FCC&rsquo;s proposal that &ndash; <strong><a href="http://time.com/96688/net-neutrality-plan-in-chaos/" target="_blank">according to TIME Magazine </a></strong>&ndash; caused utter chaos on the executive floor. <br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>For decades, the FCC building has been visited almost exclusively by lobbyists from Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon. When we showed up and put out the call to Occupy the FCC, everything changed, and we put REAL net neutrality back on the table.</strong><br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong><img alt="image" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n6ca6eg9lV1ri3xd7.jpg"/></strong></span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>This encampment would not have been possible without the incredible outpouring of support from our list and the Internet in general. <strong>Your donations, tweets, and encouragement made this happen</strong> &ndash; and we all owe an extra special thanks to the dedicated people on our list who jumped on buses to Washington, DC to join the camp.</span></p>
<p><span>As we camped out for nine days outside the FCC, hundreds of thousands of Internet activists called, e-mailed, and commented on the FCC&rsquo;s net discrimination proposal and lent support to the activists at the encampment.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="https://55.media.tumblr.com/db69b619f8274d9d492a4d8ff7371f96/tumblr_inline_n695g3s2kb1qb05d0.jpg" width="700"/></span></p>
<p><span>Even with rain pouring down on us, we kicked off our encampment with a bang. Our friends at <strong><a href="http://popularresistance.org" target="_blank">PopularResistance.org</a></strong> were first on the scene with their huge SAVE THE INTERNET banner. After the first night they started to set up tents. With the support of online activists like you, our firewall of tents grew quickly and the impact was immediate.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="https://55.media.tumblr.com/4083a67e3a4843d9461d9bcbb815fab3/tumblr_inline_n695he8hDO1qb05d0.jpg" width="700"/></span></p>
<p><span>Everyday, we were awake at 6AM, energized and ready to hand out flyers and talk to FCC employees as they came into work. By being out at the FCC earlier and later than any of their employees, we made sure every single employee, manager and security guard saw us, talked to us, and took a flyer from us. It was fun to think about our net neutrality flyers filling the FCC building, sitting on people&rsquo;s desks and inspiring lunch room conversations.<br/></span></p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://55.media.tumblr.com/cb2efa995c66cdc5b76b891322eefbe5/tumblr_inline_n695hxM2XB1qb05d0.jpg" width="700"/></p>
<p><span>We received an inspiring amount of positive support from FCC employees. Employees would thanks us for camping outside the FCC, give us high fives, or discrete thumbs ups.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>The FCC itself is split, with a majority its employees seemingly siding with us. According to <strong><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/05/07/fcc-crashes-its-live-stream-video-during-a-meeting-touting-its-new-internet-regulation-proposal/" target="_blank">an article </a></strong>in the Daily Caller, after just a few days of our encampment, employee morale at the FCC was so low that Tom Wheeler had to call a special meeting to address internal concerns with his bogus proposal. <br/></span></p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://55.media.tumblr.com/2ad6961bdfd76af1c2c8cb89b2b1407c/tumblr_inline_n695jbZBNV1qb05d0.jpg" width="700"/><img src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n6chiu8fo71qb05d0.jpg"/></p>

<p><img alt="image" src="https://55.media.tumblr.com/85a4f3ab66b480fd95456e7839ef4f4c/tumblr_inline_n6chg84oFB1qb05d0.jpg"/></p>

<p><span>As our numbers grew, the number of tents wrapping around the FCC grew as well. Our encampment was made up of activists who came all across the country from San Francisco to DC. We demonstrated that the Internet community has real power to defend itself against corporate attacks on net neutrality.<img alt="image" src="https://55.media.tumblr.com/6400110b5890601a4b1548d73b66f380/tumblr_inline_n695r5tMSO1qb05d0.jpg" width="700"/></span></p>
<p><span>Everyday as rush hour traffic picked up around 5pm, we would picket and chant outside the FCC as employees left the building. <span>Cars, trucks and buses would honk in support as w</span>e made sure every single FCC employee leaving work had to listen to us. <br/></span></p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://55.media.tumblr.com/06dbd8a4117ab6298658ac20bd929ce0/tumblr_inline_n695rkAu391qb05d0.jpg" width="700"/></p>
<p><span>Media coverage of the encampment skyrocketed as our encampment grew and the FCC lost leverage. This is Elise Hu of NPR interviewing activists at the encampment. As time went on more and more reporters and photographers came from the New York TImes, BBC, Washington Post, ABC News, CNN, The Guardian, Democracy Now &ndash; as a matter of fact, the only network that didn&rsquo;t show up was NBC (which just happens to be owned by Comcast/Universal&hellip;)<br/></span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="https://55.media.tumblr.com/f91f0781646a468c39ae2f2fbf577260/tumblr_inline_n695tbkAD91qb05d0.jpg" width="700"/></span></p>
<p><span>The FCC took notice of us. A majority of the commissioners personally came down to listen to our demands and speak to us. Above, Commissioner Ajit Pai engages in a friendly debate with Dr. Margaret Flowers, who made it clear we want Title II reclassification and nothing less.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n6chd90gtZ1qb05d0.png"/></span></p>

<p><img alt="image" src="https://55.media.tumblr.com/58f120f44712a4b5a8c4337475851581/tumblr_inline_n695tnEMg31qb05d0.jpg" width="700"/></p>
<p><span>Less than 24 hours before he pushed for a vote on his flawed proposal that could gut net neutrality, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler came down to our encampment to meet with us. He listened carefully to our demands, and did his best to paint a picture where we were on the same side. He even got his picture taken with a sign that said &ldquo;Honk for the Open Internet&rdquo; and then had a member of his staff <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/GigiBSohnFCC/status/466585799975510016#" target="_blank">tweet it.</a></strong><br/></span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n6can8Jxru1ri3xd7.jpg"/></span></p>

<p><span>But if Tom Wheeler really wanted the open Internet, he could do more than ask people to honk for it. Based on our conversations with the other Commissioners, if Wheeler pushed forward a proposal to reclassify the Internet as a common carrier and protect net neutrality, he&rsquo;d have the votes to get it passed and could be a hero for the web. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>So why doesn&rsquo;t he? Well, it could have something to do with the fact that he was an industry lobbyist for cable companies for 20 years before becoming the FCC Commissioner.</span></p>

<p>On May 15, the 9th day of the encampment and the day of the open Internet FCC hearing, dozens of groups worked together on a major rally to Save the Internet. As the rally kicked into high gear, the meeting on net neutrality was starting inside the FCC.</p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="https://55.media.tumblr.com/362a62ef2ae7b27ebc5f6770802a40a2/tumblr_inline_n6967hhugP1qb05d0.jpg" width="700"/></span></p>
<p><span>During the meeting inside the FCC, protesters were <strong><a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4498419/net-neutrality-protesters-foricbly-removed-fcc-vote-speaking-save-internet" target="_blank">forcefully removed from the room</a></strong>, including this Vietnam veteran. As they were removed from the building, press were already outside and ready to interview them about their experience inside.</span></p>
<p><span>With protesters inside and outside the FCC, Tom Wheeler decided to move forward with his proposal that includes discriminating Internet users and websites into slow lanes. </span></p>
<p><span>Even though Wheeler pushed his proposal through, we&rsquo;ve made a huge win &ndash; reclassification of the Internet (real net neutrality) is now on the table - something that was not possible two months ago when we petitioned him. If you’d like to read more about Tom Wheeler’s decision, <a href="http://www.popularresistance.org/does-the-fcc-commissioner-not-get-it-or-is-he-saying-one-thing-and-doing-another/" target="_blank">read this article. </a></span></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-40d6bdf6-3f88-5b2e-2a61-86e65333b944"><span>Now that our demands are on the table, we’ll have to continue to ramp up the pressure on the FCC in the coming months to win real net neutrality once and for all. Not only will we have to maintain the pressure on FCC, but we&rsquo;ll have to take the fight to the White House and Congress as well. </span></p>
<p><span>For starters,<strong> w</strong><span><strong>e’re telling the President Obama to fire Tom Wheeler and replace him with a FCC Chair who will actually serve the public good by reclassifying the Internet as a public utility.</strong> </span></span></p>

<p><span>Our fight to win reclassification for real net neutrality has only just begun &ndash; you can subscribe to our e-mail list and we&rsquo;ll let you know about new actions you can take to step into the fight.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>One last note &ndash; </strong>with the anniversary of the Snowden leaks coming up on June 5th, we’re moving to </span><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank"><span>Reset The Net</span></a><span> to take back privacy and stop intrusive mass surveillance. Together we can reclaim privacy on our own terms by making surveillance too difficult and too cumbersome for government agencies to intrude.<br/></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">Join our campaign to Reset The Net!</a><br/></strong></p>
<p>Stay tuned after June 5th for more important updates in the fight to keep the Internet free, open, and dare we say, awesome.</p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2014-05-22-no-single-law-will-save-us-from-the-nsa-its-time">No single law will save us from the NSA. It's time to Reset the Net to take our privacy back.</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 18:32 EDT on May 22, 2014</span>


        <p id="docs-internal-guid-c571d31b-260d-776f-3c21-6ae33fa00de1"><span>The movement against mass government surveillance is at a crossroads. </span></p>
<p><span>Today the US House of Representatives passed a dangerously watered down version of the USA Freedom Act. The bill, which was originally intended to scale back </span><span>some</span><span> domestic NSA spying, now contains huge loopholes that not only allow bulk spying to continue, but could could make it even worse, depending on how the NSA’s “creative” lawyers interpret the law.</span></p>
<p><strong>Now is a good time to reflect, regroup, and strategize.</strong><span> It’s imperative that whatever we do next in the fight against Orwellian government surveillance, we do it right and we fight to win.</span></p>
<p><span>The reality is that the USA Freedom Act was a weak bill to begin with &ndash; even before backroom deals in Congress led to last-minute changes that made it even weaker. <strong>This should be a reminder and a lesson: </strong></span><strong>if we let the government think we’ll settle for mediocre reform, they won’t even give us that.</strong></p>
<p><span>We need to stick to our one clear demand: an end to all forms of mass, suspicionless surveillance.</span><span> Internet users and people all over the world deserve to communicate and express ourselves freely without someone watching over our shoulders. Governments that indiscriminately spy on their citizens lose their legitimacy. It’s up to us to build a global movement to keep each other safe and keep the Internet free. </span></p>
<p><strong>No single piece of legislation can get us what we want.</strong><span> No single protest will save the day. No single encryption product can protect the entire web from prying eyes. This is, and has always been, a fight that we can only win if we’re ready for the long haul, and if we’re willing to work together.</span></p>
<p><span>We expect and deserve laws that protect our basic rights, but we can’t wait around exposed while politicians move slowly and feebly. <strong>We need to act right now to secure as much of the web as we can, and defend privacy and freedom of speech on our own terms.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This June 5th, 2014 is the anniversary of the first groundbreaking NSA story revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. </span><span>On this symbolic day, we have an opportunity to draw a line in the sand, and show U.S. Congress and governments around the world that we intend to take our privacy back, now. Their laws can follow our lead. </span></p>
<p><span>We are calling for everyone to join us this </span><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank"><strong>June 5th for a coordinated push called Reset the Net.</strong></a><span> On a single day thousands of tech companies, people, and organizations will take significant technical steps towards securing the web from mass surveillance. </span></p>
<p><span>In the year since Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the NSA’s most lurid abuses, the movement against mass surveillance has grown rapidly. Millions have taken action online, hundreds of thousands have called Congress, we’ve protested in the streets and developed an arsenal of new privacy technology. That’s what we’ve been doing well. We’re commanding the headlines, we have the public on our side. If we keep growing in momentum and turning up the heat, </span><strong>we are going to win.</strong></p>
<p><span>On June 5th, the Internet will rally and we will once again realize our power. Everyone has a role to play, from tech companies with millions of users to the smallest political blog. </span><span>If we all take the first step together, we will be well on our way to making the Internet ours again.</span></p>
<p><strong>Join us: <a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">http://ResetTheNet.org </a></strong></p>
