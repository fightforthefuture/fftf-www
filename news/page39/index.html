      <h1><a href="/news/2015-03-12-fight-for-the-future-statement-on-release-of-fccs/">Fight for the Future statement on release of FCC’s historic net neutrality rules</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 14:18 EDT on March 12, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>March 12, 2015<br/><br/>Contact: Evan Greer, Fight for the Future<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457 <br/>Email: <a href="mailto:press@fightforhefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforhefuture.org</a></p><p><b>Fight for the Future statement on release of FCC’s historic net neutrality rules: “The public made this happen.”</b></p><p>WASHINGTON, DC––Today the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released the full text of their historic decision to protect the openness of the Internet through strong net neutrality rules that prevent Internet service providers from blocking, throttling, or discriminating against Internet content.</p><p>Fight for the Future, a digital rights group that has been at the forefront of securing net neutrality, released the following statement, which can be attributed to campaign director Evan Greer.</p><p>The rules released today are 313 pages of fiery justice reining in some of the most abusive and powerful institutions in our country. Every single word of these rules is a direct result of the millions of people who spoke out and took action on this issue, from the brave activists who slept out in sleeping bags in front of the FCC to to the millions of ordinary people who took the time to submit a comment, call their member of Congress, or take action online using the many tools that the open Internet provided. This unprecedented victory could not have been won without the game-changing democratic openness of the Internet, and that’s exactly what this fight, and these rules, are intended to protect. Together, we have preserved the Internet as a platform for freedom of expression for generations to come, and a a revolutionary tool that can be used by all those who seek to change the world.</p><p>Fight for the Future, a group that was founded in the lead up to the fight against SOPA, have been one of the most active groups in the net neutrality fight and along with a broad coalition were lead organizers of <a href="http://occuputhefcc.com" target="_blank">Occupy the FCC</a>, the <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a> protest, <a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank">CallTheFCC.com</a>, nationwide <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/101857211418/media-advisory-net-neutrality-activists-plan" target="_blank">emergency protests</a>, and the victory stunt last month where they worked with others to <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/112237319673/breaking-grumpy-cat-soars-over-comcast" target="_blank">fly an airplane</a> over Comcast headquarters towing a banner that read “Don’t mess with the Internet.” The group has been widely quoted in major press including the New York Times.

        <span class="date">Posted 10:46 EST on March 6, 2015</span>


        <figure><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nksrs8n29q1ri3xd7.png?1492021786945"/></figure><p>Dear Fight for the Future member,</p><p>Alarm bells are ringing. We just got word from our allies in DC that U.S. Congress is getting ever closer to cutting a deal to secretively “Fast Track” the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP), a massive trade deal where decisions that affect the global future of the Internet are made behind closed doors. [1]</p><p>We need to act swiftly and strike hard. Will you call Senator Ron Wyden right now and tell him: “Please don’t betray the Internet! No Fast Track for the TPP”</p><p><b>Here’s his number: 202-224-5244</b></p><p><b><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/ronwyden" target="_blank">Can’t call? Click here to send him an email or tweet at him!</a></b></p><p>We don’t know exactly what’s in the TPP, because the U.S. government has been blocking the release of the text [2], but we do know who has a seat at the table and is helping write the sections on copyright and Internet policy: the MPAA and RIAA. [3] Yep, the same folks that brought us SOPA. </p><p>We also know from leaked versions of the text that the TPP would lead to a more censored, policed, and expensive Internet for everyone, and have all kinds of other side effects on things like access to medicine, online privacy, and even whistleblower protections. [4]</p><p>But there’s good news. One of the key Senators involved with this deal is Ron Wyden, from Oregon. He’s been a strong ally on most Internet freedom issues, and was one of the first politicians to openly oppose SOPA, back before that was the cool thing to do. </p><p>Senator Wyden should be on our side on this issue, but he hasn’t heard from enough Internet users to make him feel like it’s a real Internet freedom issue. We need to change that. And fast. </p><p><b>Call Senator Wyden right now at 202-224-5244 or <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/ronwyden" target="_blank">Click here to email or tweet him.</a></b></p><p>We are healing a Fast Track bill could be introduced as early as next month. Once that happens, it will be close to impossible to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Our best shot at stopping this thing and saving the Internet is if we can keep Senator Wyden from making that deal in the first place. </p><p>That’s why we’re emailing you today, and that’s why I’m asking you, personally, to PLEASE take action right now. Call Senator Wyden right now to say NO Fast Track for the TPP. </p><p><b>Dial 202-224-5244 or <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/ronwyden" target="_blank">Click here to email or tweet him through our handy dandy action page.</a></b></p><p>Thanks, Internet!  We’ve proven over and over again that when we fight, we win. Let’s keep it up!<br/></p><p>For the web,<br/>-Evan at FFTF</p><p>P.S. Need a primer on the TPP and what the biggest problems with it are?

The banner depicted the popular Internet meme Grumpy Cat, and read “Comcast: Don’t Mess With the Internet.”</p><h2><b><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B0chF4OQ2SPoRGhfTmxwZi10S1E&amp;usp=sharing" target="_blank">Click here for a full set of photos and videos.</a></b></h2><p><i>These photos and video clips are available for use by press and may be credited as courtesy of Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, and Free Press.</i><br/></p><figure><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nkg7fmWHyZ1r2e3za.jpg?1492021786945"/></figure><figure><img alt="image" src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/ce97bbdfce314c993a15546886661049/tumblr_inline_nkg7cmjCNS1r2e3za.jpg"/></figure><figure><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nkg7geyujM1r2e3za.jpg?1492021786945"/></figure><p><b>Here&rsquo;s a close-up of what the banner looks like:</b><br/></p><figure><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nkg2mesJlN1ri3xd7.jpg?1492021786945"/></figure><p>The stunt came after a year of escalating grassroots activism that turned the tide on Net Neutrality and led directly to yesterday’s FCC vote to approve the strongest Net Neutrality rules possible. Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, and Free Press worked together to organize<a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank"> BattleForTheNet.com</a>, which became by far the most popular Net Neutrality activism site, and also collaborated on the September 10th<a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank"> Internet Slowdown</a> protest, which attracted more than 40,000 websites as participants and drove more than 770,000 comments to the FCC in a single day. </p><p>Their most recent effort was the <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/countdown" target="_blank">Internet Countdown</a>, which was the largest sustained (lasting more than a single day) online protest effort in history, counting down to yesterday’s vote. More than 19,000 websites supported the countdown including Tumblr, reddit, Yelp, Mozilla, Kickstarter, and MediaFire.</p><p>“This is a victory of the Internet, by the Internet, and for the Internet,” said David Segal, Executive Director of Demand Progress. “Comcast and cable allies spent big for the right to degrade the very service they provide to their customers, and they tried to ignore the millions of public comments in support of Net Neutrality. But they can&rsquo;t ignore the FCC’s vote yesterday &ndash; or a plane flying over their corporate headquarters today. This banner is a message from the millions who stood up to one of the most powerful special interests in Washington: You can&rsquo;t ignore the Internet. We won at the FCC and we&rsquo;re ready to fight the ISPs and defend net neutrality in the streets and in the air, in Congress and in the courts. And we will win.&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;For too long Comcast&rsquo;s towering corporate headquarters has cast a dark shadow over Philadelphians wanting affordable access to a fast and open Internet. It&rsquo;s encouraging now to see people across the city call out the cable giant for failing to live up to its promises to protect Net Neutrality and connect more people to essential communications services,” said Mary Alice Crim, Field Director at Free Press. &quot;Millions of people are now taking a powerful stand for their rights to connect and communicate. It&rsquo;s a movement that has shifted the debate in Washington, and Comcast should take note.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Comcast should have known that Internet users would not tolerate their blatant attacks on free speech and democracy. Let this be a warning to every goliath company, government, and institution of power in the world. If you mess with the Internet, the Internet will mess with you. And the Internet always wins,&rdquo; said Fight for the Future Campaign Director Evan Greer.</p><p>###</p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-02-26-statement-from-fight-for-the-future-on-day-of/">Statement from Fight for the Future on day of historic FCC net neutrality vote</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 08:18 EST on February 26, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>February 26th, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, Fight for the Future<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457<br/>Email: <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>WASHINGTON, DC––In a matter of hours the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will vote on the strongest net neutrality rules in history. One year ago, no one thought that Title II based net neutrality rules that protect free speech online were possible in Washington, DC. But the Internet rose up to defend itself, and it won. </p><p>Fight for the Future, a digital rights group that led the grassroots charge for net neutrality, issued the following statement:</p><p><b>Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng said,</b> “This is our free speech struggle in the digital age. Institutions of power should know by now: Internet users will not stand idly by while anyone tries to take their freedom away. And when Internet users come together to fight for something they believe in, nothing can stop them.”</p><p>Fight for the Future worked with a broad coalition of advocacy groups and small tech companies to organize an escalating series of actions including <a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank">Occupy the FCC</a> and the massive <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a> protest. Using cutting edge technology, they built tools to amplify the voices of Internet users, including <a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank">CallTheFCC.com</a>, which circumvented the FCC’s switchboard and drove more than 55,000 phone calls directly to the desks of FCC employees responsible for the new net neutrality rules. Over the past month, they organized the <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/countdown" target="_blank">Internet Countdown</a>, the largest sustained online protest in history, which brought together nearly 20,000 websites to count down the seconds until the FCC’s historic vote. </p><p>Fight for the Future is a 6 person team best known for their role as catalysts in the epic <a href="http://www.sopastrike.com/numbers/" target="_blank">SOPA blackout</a> in 2012 and as the organizers of <a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">Reset the Net</a>, an online privacy campaign that was endorsed by Edward Snowden. The group was recently profiled in the <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2015/02/19/outsider-group-from-massachusetts-helped-shift-net-neutrality-fight/G08DYw0RiWFQEckTH2e3XI/story.html" target="_blank">Boston Globe</a> for their pivotal role in winning the fight for net neutrality. </p><p>###</p>
