        <span class="date">Posted 15:05 EDT on June 18, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="https://shutthebackdoor.net/?r=fftf" target="_blank"><span><img alt="image" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n7doypPJOX1ri3xd7.png"/></span></a></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-5893f9a4-b03e-c86b-4ae0-5ab5c716201f"><span><strong>Dear Fight for the Future member,</strong><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Last year, we were 12 votes shy of defunding the NSA&rsquo;s phone spying program&rsquo;s with a last minute amendment. Now we have a chance for another sneak attack, but we could have less than 24 hours to implement it and push it over the edge. Today or tomorrow, U.S. Congress will vote on an Amendment to the &ldquo;must-pass&rdquo; Defense funding bill that &ndash; if it gets enough yes votes &ndash; could close up the backdoors the NSA has been using to spy on all of us (1).</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://shutthebackdoor.net/?r=fftf" target="_blank">This is a significant silver bullet to disrupt the NSA’s blanket spying. But time is running out. Click here to take action right now!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>This Amendment is different. It’s not a big clunky bill that we can expect to get watered down by the corrupt leadership of both parties, it’s more of a Congressional guerilla tactic. Rep. Zoe Lofgren is tacking this Amendment on to the Defense Appropriations Bill, a bill that basically has to pass. She’s forcing the question &ndash; the Amendment basically says that the NSA can’t use any of the funds it’s given to conduct warrantless searches under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, and it also prevents them from building back doors into security products (2).</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://shutthebackdoor.net/?r=fftf" target="_blank">Congress doesn’t get many calls about amendments like this. Your voice matters! Click here to contact your reps.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Remember the Amash Amendment that no one thought had a chance, and then it almost passed and would have defunded some of the NSA’s programs? (3). </strong><span>If we can flood Congress with calls and emails right now, we can cut off one of the NSA’s octopus arms, and actually stop them from using our own tax dollars to spy on us. </span><strong>The vote could happen as early as this afternoon.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://shutthebackdoor.net/?r=fftf" target="_blank">Click here to to demand that Congress protect our rights and shut the backdoor the NSA has been using to invade our lives.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>We’re busy building the next phase of Reset the Net, our ongoing campaign to rid the Internet of mass surveillance through the massive spread of encryption technology, but in the meantime, this is a quick, easy, and satisfying way to make another dent in the NSA’s armor.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for all that you do,<br/>Evan, Tiffiniy, and Kevin<br/>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. We think it’s important that we all take action today and help this Amendment pass if at all possible. But we also recognize it’s limitations. Everyone in the world deserves privacy, not just U.S. citizens. That’s why we’re continuing to build a global movement around Reset the Net. Want to help? </span><strong><a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Please donate $20 (or more) today!</a></strong><span><br/></span></p>

<p></p>
<p>Dear Fight for the Future member,<br/><br/>We know how to fight the NSA. Finally.<br/><br/>It’s been one year since the Snowden leaks and, with Reset the Net, I feel like we just landed our first real punch, and got our first real result. <strong>Now the question is: can we keep fighting?</strong><br/><br/>Reset the Net worked so well. Huge services like Tumblr, Wordpress, and Sendgrid announced new encryption that–thanks to Snowden–we <em>know</em> makes spying harder. Meanwhile, thousands of sites (including Minecraft, one of the world’s most-downloaded games) drove downloads of encrypted calling and texting tools all day on Thursday.<br/><br/>Not a techie? Well, to the NSA, that means our private conversations will increasingly look like this: “I9XJKigrOgyymB1oEtF37xoKDzXuS5NbbRGT5Rq4GA1VCJYC”<br/><br/>The scale of what we’re achieving is just staggering. Sendgrid alone delivers <em>billions</em> of emails each month. Now, those emails are encrypted, safer.<br/><br/><strong>So we can’t stop now, but this is intense work!</strong> Last week was a huge lift for our small team. We think we can get dozens, maybe <em>hundreds</em> more huge sites to step up. But to do it, we&rsquo;ll need a full-time organizer: someone to approach sites, convince them to join, and plan more days of action. <strong>Can you donate to keep Reset the Net going?</strong><br/><br/><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Yes, I’ll donate to a strategy that’s winning against NSA mass surveillance.</strong></a><br/><br/>Our tiny organization is facing a battle on <em>two</em> fronts. We are finally making dents in the NSA’s surveillance system, but meanwhile America’s cable monopolies are attacking the fundamental principles of the open Internet–the ones that make campaigns like this possible. <strong>Alone, either of these would be the fight of our lives. Together, it’s almost more than we can handle.</strong><br/><br/>But we think we can do both, and we have to: each win means so much. Reset the Net was 6 months of work. Now that the campaign structure is in place, we just need to keep adding sites to our roster, and encouraging sites who&rsquo;ve already joined to keep pushing the envelope.<strong> We don’t need expensive design or development help, just one driven full-time organizer.</strong> Someone who can keep nudging this snowball forward, until it becomes an avalanche. Can you pitch in?<br/><br/><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Yes, I’ll donate to a strategy that’s shutting down NSA mass surveillance, piece by piece.</strong></a><br/><br/>This is what victory looks like. Sincerely,<br/><br/>Evan, Holmes, Tiffiniy and the whole Fight for the Future team<br/><br/>P.S. We are serious. If this email goes well we are hiring an organizer right now. Interested? Reply with links to work you’ve done.</p>

<p>Hey team,</p>
<p>My fingers are trembling a bit as I type this email — partly from exhaustion but mostly from tremendous excitement. <strong><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">Tomorrow we Reset the Net, and start on a path toward securing the web, and defending freedom for generations to come</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Just today, we received a very special message from Edward Snowden himself. All of us at Fight for the Future are humbled, knowing that our huge victories this year mobilizing against government surveillance would not have been possible without him risking everything to expose the abuses of the worlds’ most powerful governments.</p>
<p>I’m pasting Snowden’s statement in its entirety below. Please forward this email to everyone in your address book, and share this far and wide. These last few hours are critical and we need all hands on deck to push Reset the Net over the edge.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://resetthenet.org/#splash-screen" target="_blank">Edward Snowden started this, now it’s our turn to be heroes. Proudly display these badges on your sites or social media. You’ll be helping protect everyone who sees your part of the web. </a></strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;One year ago, we learned that the internet is under surveillance, and our activities are being monitored to create permanent records of our private lives — no matter how innocent or ordinary those lives might be.</em></p>
<p><em>Today, we can begin the work of effectively shutting down the collection of our online communications, even if the US Congress fails to do the same. That’s why I’m asking you to join me on June 5th for Reset the Net, when people and companies all over the world will come together to implement the technological solutions that can put an end to the mass surveillance programs of any government. This is the beginning of a moment where we the people begin to protect our universal human rights with the laws of nature rather than the laws of nations.</em></p>
<p><em>We have the technology, and adopting encryption is the first effective step that everyone can take to end mass surveillance. That’s why I am excited for Reset the Net — it will mark the moment when we turn political expression into practical action, and protect ourselves on a large scale.</em></p>
<p><em>Join us on June 5th, and don’t ask for your privacy. Take it back.”</em></p>
