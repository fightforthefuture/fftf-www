Lives are at stake,” <b>said Fight for the Future Co-founder Holmes Wilson, </b>“If we’re going to get beyond mistakes like CISA we need members of Congress who actually understand this stuff and don’t just pretend to.”</p>

The concert, which featured well known acts including Mirah and Debo Band, was followed by a training session where participants planned future actions to pressure undecided local lawmakers Rep Seth Moulton and Joe Kennedy, to vocally oppose the TPP.</p><p><b>See PHOTOS of the concert available for use by presst here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/xXUeW" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/xXUeW</a></b></p><p><b>Scroll down to see some short video clips from the concert.</b></p><p>“The Trans-Pacific Partnership is not about ‘free trade,’ it’s about corruption,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future and lead organizer of the tour, who is based in Jamaica Plain, and organizes the popular Break the Chains LGBTQ dance party series in Boston, “we’re harnessing the power of music and culture to sound the alarm about this corporate power grab and stop it in its tracks.”</p><p>Organized by digital rights group Fight for the Future in partnership with legendary guitarist Tom Morello (Prophets of Rage, Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave) and riot-folk singer Ryan Harvey’s record label Firebrand Records, previous stops on the tour have featured high-profile participants including actress Evangeline Lilly, hip hop icon Talib Kweli, comedian Hari Kondabolu, Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra, legendary punk band Anti-Flag, Danbert Nobacon of the UK sensation Chumbawamba, Adult Swim comedian Eric Andre, and ANTI records songwriter Jolie Holland.

      <h1><a href="/news/2016-10-06-yahoo-let-the-nsa-read-your-email-before-you-even/">Yahoo let the NSA read your email before you even opened it.</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:46 EDT on October 6, 2016</span>


        <p>Yahoo was just <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-nsa-exclusive-idUSKCN1241YT" target="_blank">revealed</a> to be the very first US internet company to build a program, at the request of US Intelligence Services, to search every single incoming message of every single user in real time.<br/></p><p><b>Let me say that again. Every. Single. Incoming. Message. Every user.</b></p><p>This is an absolutely unprecedented privacy violation. Surveillance experts and former government officials are saying they have never seen such a broad demand for real-time digital surveillance, nevermind one that calls for the creation of a new computer program. This program, essentially a wire-tap on the web, is beyond the scope of any of the already overreaching surveillance laws currently on the books. </p><p>“The order issued to Yahoo appears to be unprecedented and unconstitutional. The government appears to have compelled Yahoo to conduct precisely the type of general, suspicionless search that the Fourth Amendment was intended to prohibit,” said ACLU Staff Attorney Patrick Toomey.</p><p>Communication giants Microsoft, Twitter, Google, Facebook, and Apple have all rushed to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/10/04/delete-your-yahoo-account/" target="_blank">put out statements</a> assuring users that they had not received or complied with similar directives, some going so far as to say that if they had they would challenge it in court. Apple pointed to a recent <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank">statement </a>by CEO Tim Cook, which reads, “I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor in any of our products or services. We have also never allowed access to our servers. And we never will.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Yahoo <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/10/05/yahoo-offers-non-denial-denial-of-bombshell-spy-report/" target="_blank">issued a statement </a>that does not outright deny that the program existed, nor address the myriad of privacy and security concerns that have been raised.</p><p>Even former Yahoo Chief Information Security Officer, Alex Stamos, is appalled by the program. When he found out about it in 2015 he immediately resigned his position, telling coworkers that he had been excluded from the decision to implement the program. He also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/04/yahoo-secret-email-program-nsa-fbi" target="_blank">cited flaws</a> that seriously endangered the security of user data and left the program vulnerable to hackers.</p><figure data-orig-width="4198" data-orig-height="2551" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd0710418582a5572e77f494a41eab18/tumblr_inline_oemx6r3hqy1up8o7g_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="4198" data-orig-height="2551"/></figure><p><b>Yahoo is a sinking ship.</b> This is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/technology/daily-report-latest-hack-shows-yahoos-weak-security-history.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FYahoo!%20Inc.&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=business&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=collection" target="_blank">not the first </a>security problem Yahoo has struggled with. Just last month it was revealed that over 500 million (and possibly <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-insider-hacking-2016-9" target="_blank">many many millions more</a>) Yahoo user accounts were compromised by “state sponsored actors.” This hack was almost certainly a result of Yahoo <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/technology/yahoo-data-breach-hacking.html?_r=0" target="_blank">consistently refusing</a> to invest in the necessary and standard security practices adopted by their competitors after a massive hack six years ago, to which Yahoo also fell victim.</p><p>And their security is not going to get any better. Yahoo was recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/25/business/yahoo-sale.html" target="_blank">sold</a> to Verizon for 4.8 billion dollars. Telecom companies including Verizon have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations-worldwide-snowden-documents-show/2013/12/04/5492873a-5cf2-11e3-bc56-c6ca94801fac_story.html" target="_blank">colluding</a> with the NSA for years to gather information on billions of people worldwide, as Edward Snowden’s 2013 revelations have shown. Beyond handing your data to a prying NSA, Verizon also <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus-20140425-column.html" target="_blank">notoriously created</a> an innovative way to track your online habits on both your phone and on your non-Verizon devices like personal laptops. They then sell your information to marketers. The Verizon-Yahoo merger is going to compound the security issues these two companies have created, resulting in a service where your communication becomes nothing more than a piece of data to be rifled through by the government and sold to the highest bidder.</p><p><b>You deserve to have the safety and privacy you expect. It’s time to dump Yahoo.</b></p><p><b><a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN2044.html" target="_blank">Here’s how to delete your Yahoo account.</a></b></p>

The show runs from 6pm - 11pm and will also feature legendary Pittsburgh labor singer Anne Feeney, buzzworthy bi-lingual rockers Downtown Boys, plus Taina Asili, Evan Greer, Ryan Harvey, and Son of Nun, as well as speakers from a wide range of organizations opposing the TPP.<br/></p><p><b>See more details and a full lineup here: <a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org/pittsburgh-pa" target="_blank">https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org/pittsburgh-pa</a></b></p><p><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/151282317108/photos-video-rock-against-the-tpp-tour-draws" target="_blank"><b>See PHOTOS &amp; VIDEO from previous stops here.</b></a></p><p>The TPP has little to do with trade, but instead grants multinational corporations extraordinary new powers to threaten jobs, the environment, affordable medicine, free speech, and food safety.</p><p>Anti-Flag are one of the most popular musical acts to emerge from Pittsburgh, and tour extensively performing politically charged punk rock that’s half circle pit, half picket line. The band issued the following statement ahead of the November 3rd concert: &ldquo;The Rock Against The TPP shows that we have played across the US and Canada were so amazing that we had to curate one in our beloved hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - Pittsburgh, an international epicenter of the labor movement  - a city where union loyalty and the fight for human rights courses through the veins of its citizens to this very day. The Rock Against The TPP shows are beyond educational, they&rsquo;re inspirational. They are a true testament to music&rsquo;s ability to bring people together and create positive change; a rally to energize us all to continue to fight against The TPP and all of the ills it will bring to the world.&rdquo;</p><p>“The Trans-Pacific Partnership is not about ‘free trade,’ it’s about corruption,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future and lead organizer of the tour, “we’re harnessing the power of music and culture to sound the alarm about this corporate power grab and stop it in its tracks.”</p><p>Organized by digital rights group Fight for the Future in partnership with legendary guitarist Tom Morello (Prophets of Rage, Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave) and riot-folk singer Ryan Harvey’s record label Firebrand Records, previous stops on the Rock Against the TPP tour have featured high-profile participants including actress Evangeline Lilly, hip hop icon Talib Kweli, comedian Hari Kondabolu, Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra, legendary punk band Anti-Flag, Danbert Nobacon of the UK sensation Chumbawamba, and ANTI records songwriter Jolie Holland.
