## Burr-Feinstein Bill Tries To Outlaw Encryption

![BF.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/img/action-network/BF.jpg)

The technically [inept](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-encryption-back-door-20160420-story.html) co-chairs of the Senate Intelligence Committee have drafted a bill that would undo current digital security technologies instead of protecting our sensitive data and physical safety. Security experts are [saying](http://www.wired.com/2016/04/senates-draft-encryption-bill-privacy-nightmare/) this is one of the most “ridiculous, technologically illiterate, and outright dangerous pieces of legislation that Congress has cooked up. Ever.”

Senators Burr and Feinstein’s bill would [require](http://recode.net/2016/04/14/the-tech-community-is-mobilizing-against-the-burr-feinstein-encryption-bill/) companies to render information “intelligible” for government investigation upon request. This means building a backdoor into anything protected by encryption, making us particularly vulnerable to bad actors. Encryption is crucial to our safety - it protects not just our virtual lives but also our hospitals, airports and power plants.

### Sign now to tell Congress: “Encryption keeps us safe. Vote no on ANY bill that would weaken security or require government backdoors.”
