    <h2>We have another victory! Cloture vote fails on Cybersecurity Act. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23CISPA">#CISPA</a> / CSA stalled for now!</h2>
    <p>We're 3-0: SOPA in the US, ACTA in Europe and now CISPA! The internet is incredible.</p>
    <p>BREAKING: A cloture vote on the Senate version of the infamous cybersecurity bill CISPA just failed, 52-46 (it needed 60 votes to move forward).</p>
    <p>This means that the bills&mdash;which could have given government agencies access to all your personal communications&mdash;are dead in the water for now.</p>
    <p>But they'll be back. These bills have been a top priority for the Obama administration. Outcry from privacy groups tipped the scales, but an unrelated partisan battle over regulation was the main reason this bill failed&mdash;not privacy.</p>
    <p>A frightening number of Senators and Representatives see no problem in giving the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and the NSA total access to your online communications.</p>
    <p>These bills will return, as early as September, and we need to be ready. Sign up to get notified when CISPA &amp; CSA return!</p>
