title: '"Donâ€™t Mess with the Internet" - a billboard for Lamar Smith (R-TX)'
description: SOPA sponsor Lamar Smith came close to destroying the Internet we love (it took the largest online protest in history to stop him). So we thought it would be awesome if the internet sent Lamar a message, in the form of a billboard right outside his Texas office.

    SOPA author Lamar Smith (R-TX) gets a crowd-funded billboard... right
    outside his San Antonio office.

  <p>
    SOPA sponsor Lamar Smith came close to destroying the Internet we love (it
    took <a href="http://sopastrike.com/">the largest online protest in
    history</a> to stop him). So we thought it would be awesome if the internet
    sent Lamar a message, in the form of a billboard right outside his Texas
    office.

    This is an election year, and we've got a lot planned. Right now we're
    scrambling to organize Senate constituent meetings to stop CISPA /
    Lieberman-Collins. <a href="http://internetdefenseleague.org">The Internet
    Defense League</a> is gearing up to build the network that stopped SOPA into
    an ongoing force for good. We'll be taking aim at the US "6-strikes" regime.
    And even bigger things are in the works for the November election.

    Check out our past work, and if you're impressed, make a generous donation.
    We're a small team and we've had a huge impact so far. Your support will go
    a long way.

  <p>
    <strong>P.S.</strong>
    We'd love to see photos of people who took part in the blackout standing in
    front of the billboard. Send them to
    <a href="mailto:team@fightforthefuture.org">team@fightforthefuture.org</a>
    :)

    (The first is as close to his San Antonio office as we could get: Loop 410,
    500 ft. east of Nacogdoches. And the second is on Lamar Blvd. in Austin
    between 12th St and 15th St --his Austin office doesn't have any billboards
    nearby.)
