    <h2>This week is our last moment to stop CISPA, the internet government surveillance system, before it becomes US law.</h2>

    <p>Groups like the EFF and the ACLU worked closely with pro-privacy senators to get strong privacy protections into the Senate's version of CISPA.  That's the good news.</p>

    <p>The problem?  The Senate bill isn't guaranteed to be good for privacy. A large number of Senators are pushing for a version that eliminates consumer privacy laws and gives broad new powers to web companies to monitor you, block you from their sites, and share your personal info with the government.</p>

    <p>Your call could actually tip the scales.  If we can convince just a handful of Senators to stand up for our rights to privacy, we can significantly improve the bill or block it entirely.</p>

    <p>Please call today.  If you can't call, send an email.</p>
