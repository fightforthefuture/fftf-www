# Campaign Director

Fight for the Future is accepting applications for a Campaign Director, a key leadership role that includes developing, running, and implementing the organization’s innovative and highly effective campaigns to protect and expand the Internet’s power for good.

We are a small but powerful activism team. Our vision: a world where everyone can access the Internet affordably, free of interference and censorship and with full privacy. To accomplish this, we are using the Internet in innovative ways to mobilize people on a scale previously thought to be impossible. We've built the technology and created the messaging behind the largest online protests in history, including organizing the campaign that defeated SOPA/PIPA, and winning net neutrality rules in 2014. Just last month, we garnered over [6 million views](https://www.twitch.tv/fight_for_the_future) while livestreaming the Congressional debate over the Save the Internet Act, generating tens of thousands of phone calls and letters to Congress.

Our model for activism includes the following ingredients: a skilled, nimble team with a fire for political change and an ability to move fast; an uncompromising focus on strategic campaigning and specific wins; a unique approach to campaigning which includes tapping into the power of the Internet; and the ability to speak with a strong voice online.

We’re looking for smart, strategic, and highly creative candidates with significant campaigning or organizing experience for our Campaign Director role. If you want to build online campaigns that reach hundreds of millions of people, and ensure technology is a force for good then this is the dream job for you. And did we mention we are 100% remote and you’ll work from home?

Your day-to-day could include flooding a congressional office with an avalanche of phone calls or creating media coverage so huge that a telecom executive resigns.

## More specifically, you will be:
* Developing and driving advocacy strategies that advance the organization's key policy goals through close coordination with the organization’s leadership.
* Creating high-quality, engaging communications materials including mass emails, press releases, news pitches, web pages, event materials, video scripts, social media content, op-eds, and fundraising appeals.
* Acting as a lead spokesperson to the media on our campaigns. Our campaigns are regularly covered by big outlets including NPR, The New York Times, NBC News, CNN, Wired, Buzzfeed, The Atlantic, CBS News, USA Today, and the Wall Street Journal.
* Establishing and managing relationships with small businesses, prominent technology companies, grassroots organizations, and civil society stakeholders on a project-by-project basis.
* Leading national campaign actions such as distributed protests, rallies, and lobby days.
* Working with designers and developers as a project manager of websites, campaign actions, and more.
* Working closely with other campaigns staff  and managing contractors, with the strong possibility of supervising full-time staff after a few months in the role.
* Identifying, monitoring, and analyzing regulatory and legislative developments affecting Fight for the Future’s campaigns and policy positions at the state, federal, and international level.
* Developing Fight for the Future’s policy positions in consultation with community members and staff, and consulting policy and technical experts as required.
* Distilling complicated tech policy issues into easy-to-understand messages for a wide range of audiences.
* Supporting other organizational needs such as staff and volunteer recruitment, fundraising, and special projects.

Note: You could be taking on all of the responsibilities or it may be that you take on fewer given your deeper expertise in one or more areas. We can talk more about how we shape the job and what additional training you’ll need to step into newer responsibilities.

## What we’re looking for in you:
* You have at least eight years of experience in relevant fields which include campaigns, advocacy, grassroots organizing, digital marketing, or writing/journalism.
* You have expertise in campaigning and understand what it takes to move the needle, including how to build power on an issue, who we need with us, messaging that will move people, and the steps to get us there.
* You have professional writing experience, especially for large audiences, including online audiences and traditional media. You can synthesize complex ideas into concise, easily understandable copy for the web. Your writing can speak to people’s humor, fears and what gets both their head nodding and heart pumping.
* You thrive at working in a campaign setting and can move with urgency in speed. You are familiar with the pace of news cycle and understands how quickly you need to move and hard you need to hustle to ensure our voice is heard.
* You have project management and organizational skills that enable you to keep a number of projects on track and delegate to other members of our team and contractors.
* You are talented at generating media coverage on campaigns, from developing traditional media plans to writing press materials and reaching out and developing relationships with traditional media sources.
* You have experience with and a commitment to working with people from a variety of backgrounds, including racial, ethnic, socio-economic, and religious backgrounds, and people from the LGBTQ community.
* You can communicate with people who are different from you, who may have different backgrounds and perspectives, and who hold political beliefs that you may passionately oppose.
* You have played a key role in making something big happen, whether it was a high profile campaign, a groundbreaking investigative report, launching a startup, or a successful music career.
* You are fascinated by the power of the Internet and have used it in creative ways.
* You have a rigorous and thought-provoking perspective on a wide range of political issues. You are a thinker and someone who can synthesize a problem or an idea out of ordinary interaction and someone’s frustrations/struggles.

## Bonus points for:
* A background running digital campaigns that grow fast.

Our model of activism relies on a relentless focus on strategy and working toward specific wins; campaigning that taps into the power of the Internet; and the ability to speak with a strong voice online. We are a fully remote organization and you would work from home or a shared work space.

We’re looking for smart and strategic candidates with excellent writing skills and the drive to make urgent but critical wins on a quick timeline.

* Identifying, monitoring, and analyzing political developments around Internet freedom and tech policy issues related to our campaigns and policy positions at the state, federal, and international level.
* Quickly assessing the opportunity (good or bad) and what role FFTF should play, who the key decision-makers are, and which actions would be most strategic, coordinating closely with the campaigns team.

* Creating high-quality, engaging communications materials including mass emails and SMS, news pitches, campaign pages, event materials, and social media content.

# A-Teams Political Strategist Co-founder
## Political operative (lobbyist/staffer/PR) who is ready to play the outside game

Our new initiative A-Teams aims to create new, small teams that can achieve surprising political wins in the issue area of their choice, by combining political strategy and Internet savvy.

We are seeking the founding political strategist and campaign director for one such “A-Team.” As the A-Team’s political strategist, you will focus on a political issue, such as immigration reform, climate change, prison reform, health care, or voting rights. You and your A-Team will run a campaign to pass strong policy on your issue or stop a disastrous bill from becoming law.

You should have a strong, insider-level understanding of the political process, but with an outsider’s optimism, creativity, and ability to speak about issues in ways that resonate with other outsiders, such as the public or any key constituency you need to move. At the core of all of your work, you seek to figure out how to climb over any barriers in your way, problem solve to make what is needed to capture the debate, and know how to bring millions of people to bear on an issue.

You should also have some political attitudes about power, freedom, fairness, or caring for others that you carry with you since your teenage years. This should come through in your writing; you should have a strong, authentic voice.

You will work alongside a creative, multidisciplinary software developer/designer with all of the skills needed to leverage the Internet to reach and organize millions. We’ll work with you both to develop and execute plans.


## What you’ll do

* Provoke a robust public debate in chosen political area by creating content (writing, video, web) and new realities (such as sign-on letters, events, rallies, protests, alliances, etc.) that support your position.
* Look for cases where the public wants a certain policy, but where corruption or political inertia is holding it back.
* Identify the forces and alliances that, if mobilized, could break through the corruption/inertia and achieve a political win.
* Mobilize those forces and alliances, again and again, honing your skill over time.
* Generate social and traditional media attention that advances your position, organizing events and building strategic relationships as needed.
* Throughout every stage in this process, you’re constantly looking for ways to use the Internet, politics, PR, and policy to increase the power and efficacy of your small team.
* Recruit additional A-Teams leaders and volunteers as needed.

## What we’re looking for

* You have a mind for campaigning and everything it takes to win, including how to build power on the issue, who we need with us, messaging that will move people, and the steps to get you there. And you want to lead others to victory.
You have a strong sense of how state and federal politics works.
* You ideally have experience working on issue-based advocacy campaigns.
* You have a strong sense of how state and federal politics works.
* That said, you can think outside the box, see opportunities that others write off, and make new things happen.
* You understand convention but aren’t bound by it.
* You can get things done, but believe plans are made to break and change.
* You see opportunity to break the status quo of the political process all the time.
* You write beautifully, especially for an online audience.
* Political inside jokes and gossip bore you.
* You get beltway politics, but would rather be speaking to the rest of the country/world.
* You enjoy unplugging from news and Twitter to work on something big.
* You’re a bit of a social chameleon. You feel at home in many circles. You can quickly see how people in a certain scene talk and understand the world, and you can fit right in while still holding on to and spreading your perspective.
* You hold seemingly contradictory political beliefs. Sometimes people on your own political “side” might terrify you, while the other “side” seems more wise.
* You get more excited reading classics of fiction or political theory than watching House of Cards. (House of Cards is not a mortal sin—many of our most respected colleagues do it!—but you’re much broader.)
* You can be crafty and devious. Maybe you were a troublemaker in high school.
* For most of your life you’ve felt compelled to right wrongs or challenge arbitrary authority.
* Your life has intersected with a large political uprising of some kind.
* You’ve maybe been arrested before, for doing something you will never regret.
* You are a fluent English speaker and live in the US.

## Details:
This is a full time position with Fight for the Future. The salary range is $70-100K annually, depending on experience with benefits including full health care, partially covered dental benefits, and training and mentoring with senior staff. If a contract set-up works better for you, we can discuss that too.

# A-Teams Design Co-founder
## Web designer / front-end developer for high impact political activism.

Our new initiative A-Teams aims to create new, small teams that can achieve surprising political wins on the issue area of their choice, by combining political strategy and Internet savvy.

We are seeking a Design Co-founder for our next “A-Team”, to play a lead role in launching and co-leading a small activist team running a campaign to win on issues like immigrant rights, criminal justice reform, strengthening democratic representation, or climate change.

Working closely with a political co-founder, you and your A-Team will build the web and mobile pieces of a campaign to pass strong policy on your issue or stop a disastrous bill from becoming law.  Your role will be to explain complex issues—and get people to take effective political action—using design, copy, and code. We’re looking for someone with very strong visual and interaction design skills who can move from mockups to HTML/CSS, or design directly in code. Experience with modern front-end frameworks is a plus.

You should be comfortable making and launching novel and creative additions to people’s online life with strong use of layout, color, and typography, whether for web, mobile, or social media. You should love the rush of launching a site on a whim, and seeing it blow up in places like Product Hunt, HN, or reddit.

In addition to your design skills you should also have strong political attitudes about power, freedom, fairness, or caring for others that shows in your visual work; your work should be strong, immersive, and authentic.

You will work alongside a similarly high-functioning and creative person with concrete experience on campaigns so significant experience in politics or activism is not required. The team at Fight for the Future will work with you both to develop and execute plans.


## What you’ll do

* Design and build websites (sometimes straight to code) to tweak and deploy rapidly
* Make images and animation for social media
* Use copy, color, layout, typography and shared visual vocabulary (images, icons, effects) to convey complex political ideas and emotions.
* Build simple forms and sometimes more complex interactions to mobilize people around specific political objectives (i.e. design high-converting landing pages to get people to do stuff!)
* Make awesome moments in the history of the Internet and politics.
* Work closely with the political director to strategize and look for ways to use the Internet and politics to increase the power and efficacy of your small team.
* Build a new organization or movement (if it goes well!)


## What we’re looking for

* You can write clear instructions, prompts, and documentation.
* You can speak with a strong, authentic, and credible voice online.
* You can design straight to code, when needed.
* Your portfolio site looks great.
* You can make modern forms, buttons and layouts in your sleep.
* You have some experience with animation.
* You can easily grasp what makes a product valuable/awesome and work from there.
* You’re experienced working remotely.
* You quickly understand and internalize what your team or company is driving for.
* You’ve felt compelled to right wrongs or challenge arbitrary authority. Possibly a troublemaker in high school or a handful for your parents.
* You’re purpose-driven so you can pivot easily. Dropping / throwing away work doesn’t bother you, if the new path makes more sense.
* You’re pragmatic and flexible in your habits.
* You intuitively seek the simplest possible solutions, on the fly, and are good at simplifying scope to fit deadlines, saying “no” to features or—even better—“but what if I did it this other, much simpler way?”
* You can dial your design and coding approach between “quick & dirty” and “careful & prudent”, depending on the context.
* You can match styles and technical possibilities (such as an action tool or online stunt) to a given political objective or strategy, and pick the best tech response to a given situation.
* You have a desire to use your skills and smarts to make the world more kind and fair.

## Details:
This is a full time position with Fight for the Future. The salary range is $70-100K annually, depending on experience. Benefits include health care, dental benefits, and training and mentoring with senior staff. If a contract set-up works better for you, we can discuss that too.

This is a remote position and candidates can based anywhere in the US. English fluency is required.
