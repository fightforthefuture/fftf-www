## Brief

Fight for the Future is a non-profit organization whose mission is to ensure that the web continues to hold freedom of expression and creativity at its core. We primarily work on high value, fearless projects that can be seen by millions. We’re a very small team, but we’re always looking for new people with brilliant ideas. Fight for the Future is 100% remote and timezone flexible. Please see below for our current job openings.

***
# (Mostly) Front-End Software Engineer
## A UX ENTHUSIAST AND ENGINEER, FOR DEFENDING THE INTERNET

## About the role:
Fight for the Future is looking for a software engineer to work on the front-end development side of our digital campaigning work. This is more than a simple coding or campaigning position. This is a position for someone who understands the threats that face the future of free expression on the Internet, and who can creatively use the Internet as a medium for political change.

## About you:

* You’re an excellent front-end coder who can make things work and work well for millions of users.
* You can faithfully implement others’ designs and make good decisions about layout, typography, and color when needed (but you definitely don’t need to be an expert designer or have illustration skills!)
* You can build high quality user interaction with intuitive prompts, modals, clear buttons, etc, spotting and fixing UI problems as you go.
* You could design straight to code if needed, and while your own design choices don’t have to look fancy or highly polished (authentic is often better!) the result should be crafted, professional and ready to put in front of millions of people.
* You are familiar with current product innovations, messaging apps, social media, UI/UX, and design.
* You are comfortable using (or getting up to speed on) back-end technologies when needed.
* You are a curious person who likes to learn about new developments in the field and can think about a challenge from different angles.
* You understand rapid prototyping and release, user adoption, and A/B testing, and you can navigate cost/benefits analysis of various technical solutions, languages, and architecture-based decisions.
* You can think on your feet, be organized, optimize project plans and workload, and lead/delegate the different pieces of projects.
* You enjoy a rapidly changing environment and can pivot quickly as needed to make changes based on changing outside requirements.
* You like brainstorming ways to simplify the scope of a project to fit a given timeline (e.g. if the team asks for something crazy/hard, maybe there’s a much easier way to achieve a similar result) and you’re always looking for those kinds of lovely simplifications.
* You’re happy doing some self-QA and tweaking until a user experience works reliably and feels nice.
* You’re good at thinking into and around a problem, exposing corner cases and potential issues to non-technical collaborators.
* You can match styles and technical possibilities (such as an action tool or online stunt) to a given political objective or strategy, and pick the best tech response to a given situation.

## What you'll be building:

 * Precise HTML/CSS paired with clear, modern design, and intuitive UX to send powerful messages out into the world & apply political pressure in the right places at the right time.
 * Modern JavaScript (ES6), build tools (Webpack), and framework-driven interactive sites (Vue, Nuxt). These tools are changing rapidly, so learning on the job is encouraged.
 * Solutions that achieve our goals by using and customizing existing services (CRM, publishing tools, etc).
 * Innovative or unconventional tools to effectively mobilize a large audience.

## Thing you might like about this job:

 * It’s telecommute work with a 100% remote team.
 * We do retreats and in-person sprints too, because it’s nice to see people!
 * The work will be highly varied, like freelancing on a variety of projects.
 * Be a heroine/hero to many. The “yeah, I made that” small talk in bars is fun.

## Requirements:

 * Experience writing modern HTML/CSS with responsive design techniques and awareness of common cross-browser problems.
 * An understanding of client-side JavaScript - AJAX, handling events, DOM manipulation and cross-browser compatibility.
 * Knowledge of progressive enhancement strategies and ability to create simple sites that can function with JavaScript disabled or seamlessly integrate subtle CSS transitions for a refined user experience.
 * An ability to do clean and classy design when needed.
 * Ability to make good UI/UX decisions and spot problems.
 * You have a desire to use your skills and smarts for winning concrete victories to expand the Internet’s power for good.

## Bonus points for:

 * Familiarity with static site generators - many of our campaign microsites are built on Nuxt.
 * Experience writing modern JavaScript (ES6) and using build tools like Webpack, Gulp or Grunt. These tools are changing rapidly, so again, learning on the job is encouraged.
 * Experience building front-end applications with a modern framework like Vue, React, or Angular.
 * Any experience writing server-side code, mobile apps, or working with esoteric technologies.
 * Having successfully launched a great product working in a small team
 * Ability to build and lead teams
 * Some level of participation in communities like Reddit or HN
 * Lots of remote / freelance experience solving problems on tight deadlines
 * Persuasive writing skills for an online audience
 * Experience working remotely (we use Slack/Trello/Google Hangouts)

## Mega bonus points for:

 * Having built and marketed your own product.
 * Having been a leader—of anything—especially online, especially tech-related
 * Experience with activism, resistance, creative and positive troublemaking, or any kind of fiery provocative work in any area.

## Who we are:
We are a small, committed team of activists who come from a variety of backgrounds (including tech, nonprofit fundraising shops, campaign organizations, and the music scene). We pride ourselves on being a welcoming place to work for women, the LGBTQ community, people of color, people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, and parents.

## Compensation:
This is a full-time position and the range for this position is a total compensation package of $70-$100K, depending on experience. Benefits include the option for full health care and partially covered dental benefits, the value of which would be included in the total compensation package. Additional benefits include a 401K plan and paid sick, vacation, and federal holidays days. We offer support for remote work, training and mentoring, and a driven, highly collaborative, supportive work environment. We’d like to start working with you on a contract basis at an hourly rate of $45 to $75 (depending on experience), but we will be able to offer full-time position with competitive salary and benefits to the right person and can discuss what you are looking for during the interview process.

## How to apply:
In your application, we'd like you to include links to any public repos, sample code (as many examples as possible) and good examples of HTML/CSS work and UI/UX or design. Please also include a thoughtful cover letter which explains why you want to do mission-based work and let us know where you heard about the job.

# Senior Campaigner

Fight for the Future is a small but highly effective Internet freedom activism team with big victories to its credit, including organizing the protests that defeated SOPA/PIPA, and winning net neutrality rules in 2014. Our model for activism includes the following ingredients: highly skilled people who could be doing anything but truly have a fire for achieving political change; an uncompromising focus on specific wins; a small nimble team that can move fast; and the ability to speak with a strong voice online, which includes leading with product and design.

We’re looking for one of these highly skilled people to fill our Senior Campaigner position. If you ever wanted to build online experiences that reach out, grab people, and help them change the world, then this is the job for you.

## What you’ll do:

* Work closely with organizational leadership and the campaigns team to implement advocacy strategies that advance the organization's key policy goals.
* Draft high-quality, engaging communications materials including mass emails, press releases, news pitches, web pages, event materials, social media content, op-eds, and fundraising appeals.
* Act as a spokesperson to the media on our campaigns. Our campaigns are regularly covered by big outlets including NPR, The New York Times, NBC News, CNN, Wired, Buzzfeed, The Atlantic, CBS News, USA Today, and the Wall Street Journal.
* Establish and manage relationships with small businesses, prominent technology companies, grassroots organizations, and civil society stakeholders on a project-by-project basis.
* Coordinate national campaign actions such as distributed protests, rallies, and lobby days.
* Work with tech team -- designers and developers --  as a project manager of websites, campaign actions, and more. You will also work with contract staff and potentially supervise a staff member.
* Identify, monitor, and analyze regulatory and legislative developments affecting Fight for the Future’s campaigns and policy positions at the state, federal, and international level.
* Assist in the development of Fight for the Future’s policy positions in consultation with community members and staff, and consult policy and technical experts as required.
* Distill complicated tech policy issues into easy-to-understand messages for a wide range of audiences.
* As needed, support other organizational needs such as staff and volunteer recruitment, fundraising, and special projects.

## What we’re looking for in you:

* You have a minimum of 5 years of relevant work experience. If you’ve been a digital campaigner that’s a plus but not a requirement if you have many of the qualifications listed below. This experience could also include working in journalism (especially tech), founding a startup, leading on policy at a tech company, or working in digital marketing.
* You have a knack for campaigning and understand what it takes to move the needle, including how to build power on the issue, who we need with us, messaging that will move people, and the steps to get you there.
* You have experience writing for online audiences and can synthesize complex ideas into concise, easily understandable copy for the web. You can break down a complicated policy debate into a series of headlines and subheadlines, a tweet or a press release.
* Your writing can speak to people’s humor, fears and what gets both their head nodding and heart pumping.
* You have management and organizational skills that enable you to keep a number of projects on track and delegate to other members of our team and contractors.
* You have experience building support with a variety of stakeholders, including individual supporters, allied organizations, companies, and elected officials.
* You understand and can express in ways that resonate with your audience the nuances and overarching themes of tech policy, free Internet principles, and organizing on the ground and online.
* You have experience reaching out and developing relationships with traditional media and generating coverage for campaigns.
* You have played a key role in making something big happen, whether it was a high profile campaign, a groundbreaking investigative report, launching a startup, or a successful music career.
* You are fascinated by the power of the Internet and have used it in creative ways.
* You have a rigorous and thought-provoking perspective on a wide range of political issues, and especially on the Internet freedom and tech policy. You are a thinker and someone who can synthesize a problem or an idea out of ordinary interaction and someone’s frustrations/struggles.
* You have an interest in pulling off tactics and strategy and using whatever resources are at your disposal—you should have an interest in using law, policies, pop culture, music, philosophy, subcultural themes, memes, language, history, media, organizing playbooks, and whatever else is out there to pull off a really hard-hitting and exciting campaign for the right audience.
* You can communicate with people who are different from you, who may have different backgrounds and perspectives, and who hold political beliefs that you may passionately oppose.

## Bonus points for:
* A background running digital-native campaigns that grow fast.
* Previous experience in Internet or digital rights policy and issues.
* Experience working remotely.
* Coding and/or design skills.

## Who we are:
Our team comes from a variety of backgrounds -- including startups, the music industry, and campaign organizations -- and we’re open to adapting a role to play to your strengths. We’re looking for well-rounded individuals who have a range of interests, can do a little bit of everything, and know what they’re really good at! We pride ourselves on being a welcoming place to work for women, the LGBTQ community, people of color, people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, as well as parents.

## Compensation

This is a full-time position and the range for this position is a total compensation package of $60-90K, depending on experience. Benefits include the option for full health care and partially covered dental benefits, the value of which would be included in the total compensation package. Additional benefits include a 401K plan and paid sick, vacation, and federal holidays days. We offer support for remote work, training and mentoring, and a driven, highly collaborative, supportive work environment. We’d like to start working with you on a contract basis at an hourly rate of $40 to $70 (depending on experience), but we will be able to offer a full-time position with competitive salary and benefits to the right person and can discuss what you are looking for during the interview process.

## Location

Fight for the Future is a 100% remote organization so no need to commute or relocate. If you’re interested in relocation, let us know. Our staff are based all over the country (and a couple of international locations too) and work over video, slack, and through project management tools.

## To apply

Please click on the apply button below and fill out the application. In your application, please let us know where you heard about the jobs and include links to or samples of your writing—ideally in situations where you’re writing to persuade a group of people. Include as much relevant information as possible: significant things you’ve accomplished and projects you’ve worked on. Being well-rounded is a plus, so don’t exclude significant skills or achievements just because they aren’t activism related (such as starting a business or being a musician).

# Contract Web Designer / Front-End Developer for political activism team

We are seeking a contract web designer/ developer for our next “A-Team”, to play a key role in launching and co-leading a small activist team running a campaign to win on immigrant rights, criminal justice reform, or strengthening democratic representation.

Fight for the Future is known for its new model of activism focused on Internet freedom and has big victories to its credit, such as organizing the protests that defeated SOPA/PIPA, and winning net neutrality rules in 2014.

Our new initiative A-Teams aims to create new, small teams that can achieve surprising political wins on the issue area of their choice, by combining political strategy and Internet savvy.

We are seeking a contract designer / front-end developer for one such “A-Team”, in a short-term capacity which could lead to a long-term role. As the designer and technical lead, you will focus on one of our priority political areas, such as immigrant rights, criminal justice reform, or strengthening democratic representation. Working closely with a political director, you and your A-Team will build the web and mobile pieces of a campaign to pass strong policy on your issue or stop a disastrous bill from becoming law. Your role will be to explain complex issues—and get people to take effective political action—using design, copy, and code. We’re looking for someone with very strong visual and interaction design skills who can move from mockups to HTML/CSS, or design directly in code. Experience with modern front-end frameworks is a plus.

You should be comfortable making and launching novel and creative additions to people’s online life with strong use of layout, color, and typography, whether for web, mobile, or social media. You should love the rush of launching a site on a whim, and seeing it blow up in places like Product Hunt, HN, or reddit.

In addition to your design skills you should also have strong political attitudes about power, freedom, fairness, or caring for others that shows in your visual work; your work should be strong, immersive, and authentic.

You will work alongside a similarly high-functioning and creative person with concrete experience on campaigns so significant experience in politics or activism is not required. The team at Fight for the Future will work with you both to develop and execute plans.

## What you'll do

* Design and build websites (sometimes straight to code) to tweak and deploy rapidly
* Make images and animation for social media
* Use copy, color, layout, typography and shared visual vocabulary (images, icons, effects) to convey complex political ideas and emotions.
* Build simple forms and sometimes more complex interactions to mobilize people around specific political objectives (i.e. design high-converting landing pages to get people to do stuff!)
* Make awesome moments in the history of the Internet and politics.
* Work closely with the political director to strategize and look for ways to use the Internet and politics to increase the power and efficacy of your small team.
* Build a new organization or movement (if it goes well!)


## What we’re looking for

* You can write clear instructions, prompts, and documentation.
* You can speak with a strong, authentic, and credible voice online.
* You can design straight to code, when needed.
* Your portfolio site looks great.
* You can make modern forms, buttons and layouts in your sleep.
* You have some experience with animation.
* You can easily grasp what makes a product valuable/awesome and work from there.
* You’re experienced working remotely.
* You quickly understand and internalize what your team or company is driving for.
* You’ve felt compelled to right wrongs or challenge arbitrary authority. Possibly a troublemaker in high school or a handful for your parents.
* You’re purpose-driven so you can pivot easily. Dropping / throwing away work doesn’t bother you, if the new path makes more sense.
* You’re pragmatic and flexible in your habits.
* You intuitively seek the simplest possible solutions, on the fly, and are good at simplifying scope to fit deadlines, saying “no” to features or—even better—“but what if I did it this other, much simpler way?”
* You can dial your design and coding approach between “quick & dirty” and “careful & prudent”, depending on the context.
* You can match styles and technical possibilities (such as an action tool or online stunt) to a given political objective or strategy, and pick the best tech response to a given situation.
* You have a desire to use your skills and smarts to make the world more kind and fair.

This is a part or full time contract role with Fight for the Future through an hourly contract rate of $40 to $75, depending on experience. We’re ideally looking for initial commitment of three to six months, but we can talk about the timeline which works for you.

This is a remote position and candidates can based anywhere in the US. English fluency is required.

Please click on the apply button below and fill out the application. When applying, please include a résumé, links to samples (both live and source code), and a cover letter which explains why you want to do mission-based work. Please include where you heard about the opportunity.

# Campaign Director for Immigrant Rights campaign

We’re launching a new political team to reform immigration policy and ensure all people, no matter what their country of origin, get the respect and protection they deserve.

Fight for the Future is known for its new model of activism focused on Internet freedom and has big victories to its credit. We organized the protests that defeated SOPA/PIPA and helped win net neutrality rules in 2014.

Our new initiative A-Teams aims to bring our effective model of political change to other issue areas. Our small teams can achieve surprising political wins in the issue area of their choice, by combining political strategy and Internet savvy.

We are seeking the founding campaign director for an immigration reform “A-Team”. If you want to cut through the current partisan and often-times racist immigration debate and stop the aggressive policing and surveilling for immigrants, then read on. We believe that pro-immigration policies are in line with the core values of our country and strengthen our economy while building on our diverse heritage.

If you are ready to run a campaign that helps to dramatically change the debate and achieve concrete victories for people, this role is for you. The immigration reform A-Team will provide the grassroots and insider pressure, sharp messaging, and media attention needed for new reforms (and to stop outrageous ones), such as protecting the privacy and dignity of all people, protecting asylum seekers, establishing a path to citizenship, and protecting programs which ensure basic human rights like schooling, employment, and keeping immigrant families together.

As this team’s campaign director, you will run a campaign to pass strong policy to ensure immigrant rights are protected and expanded.

You should have a strong, insider-level understanding of the political process, but with an outsider’s optimism, creativity, and ability to speak about issues in ways that resonate with other outsiders, such as the public or any key constituency you need to move. At the core of all of your work, you seek to figure out how to climb over any barriers in your way, problem solve to make what is needed to capture the debate, and know how to bring millions of people to bear on an issue. You may have been a lobbyist or a part of the “inside” political game until now but are ready to take that knowledge and apply it to a winning inside-outside game. You may not have experience in all aspects of campaigning, but you are ready to take your experience into a high stakes fight, learning new skills as you go.

You should also have some political attitudes about power, freedom, fairness, or caring for others that you carry with you since your teenage years. This should come through in your writing; you should have a strong, authentic voice.

You will work alongside a creative, multidisciplinary software developer with all of the skills needed to maximize the Internet to reach and organize millions. We’ll work with you both to develop and execute plans.

## What you’ll do
* Provoke a robust public debate on immigrant rights issues by creating content (writing, video, web) and new realities (such as sign-on letters, events, rallies, protests, alliances, etc.) that support your position.
* Look for cases where the public wants a certain immigrant rights policy, but where corruption or political inertia is holding it back.
* Identify the influencers and alliances that, if mobilized, could break through the corruption/inertia and achieve a political win.
* Mobilize those influencers and alliances, again and again, honing your skill over time.
* Generate social and traditional media attention that advances your position, organizing events and building strategic relationships as needed.
* Organize millions in a political moment that breaks open the debate, and moves us exponentially closer to victory.
* Throughout every stage in this process, you’re constantly looking for ways to use the Internet, politics, PR, and policy to increase the power and efficacy of your small team.
* Recruit additional A-Teams leaders and volunteers as needed.

## What we’re looking for
* You have an understanding of how state and federal politics works.
* You ideally have experience working on issue-based advocacy campaigns. Bonus points for experience on immigration reform or other social justice issues.
* That said, you can think in an unexpected way, see opportunities that others write off, and make new things happen.
* You have a mind for campaigning and everything it takes to win, including how to build power on the issue, who we need with us, messaging that will move people, and the steps to get you there. And you want to lead others to victory.
* You write beautifully and authentically, especially for an online audience.
* You are fascinated by the power of the Internet and have used it in creative ways.
* You understand convention but aren’t bound by it. You can innovate, come up with the (crazy but just might work?!) new ideas that breaks the mold and takes things to a new level.
* You can plug holes, see what’s missing.
* You can get things done, but believe plans are made to break and change.
* You see opportunity to break the status quo of the political process all the time.
* You are rigorous and tenacious about getting to honest answers and using them to find ways to break open a debate and bring people together.
* At some point, you worked really, really hard for something that made a significant difference in people’s lives.
* Political inside jokes and gossip bore you.
* You get beltway politics, but would rather be speaking to the rest of the country/world.
* You’re a bit of a social chameleon. You feel at home in many circles. You can quickly see how people in a certain scene talk and understand the world, and you can fit right in while still holding on to and spreading your perspective.
* You hold seemingly contradictory political beliefs. Sometimes people on your own political “side” might terrify you, while the other “side” seems more wise.
* You can be crafty and devious. Maybe you were a troublemaker in high school.
* For most of your life you’ve felt compelled to right wrongs or challenge arbitrary authority.

This is a full time position with Fight for the Future. The salary range is $70-100K annually, depending on experience with benefits including full health care, partially covered dental benefits, and training and mentoring with senior staff. If a contract set-up works better for you, we can discuss that too.

This is a remote position and candidates can based anywhere in the US. English fluency is required.

# A-Teams Political Strategist Co-founder
## Political operative (lobbyist/staffer/PR) who is ready to play the outside game

Fight for the Future is a small Internet freedom activism team with big victories to its credit, such as organizing the protests that defeated SOPA/PIPA, and winning net neutrality rules in 2014.

Our new initiative [A-Teams](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/ateams/) aims to create new, two-person teams that can achieve surprising political wins in the issue area of their choice, by combining political strategy and Internet savvy.

We are seeking the founding political strategist and campaign director for one such “A-Team.” As the A-Team’s political strategist, you will focus on a political issue, such as climate change, prison reform, health care, or voting rights. You and your A-Team will run a campaign to pass strong policy on your issue or stop a disastrous bill from becoming law.

You should have a strong, insider-level understanding of the political process, but with an outsider’s optimism, creativity, and ability to speak about issues in ways that resonate with other outsiders, such as the public or any key constituency you need to move.

You should also have some political attitudes about power, freedom, fairness, or caring for others that you carry with you since your teenage years.

You will work alongside a creative, multidisciplinary software developer with all of the skills needed to leverage the Internet to reach and organize millions. We’ll work with you both to develop and execute plans.

## What you’ll do

* Provoke a robust public debate in chosen political area by creating content (writing, video, web) and new realities (such as sign-on letters, events, rallies, protests, alliances, etc.) that support your position.
* You have experience working on issue-based advocacy campaigns.
* Look for cases where the public wants a certain policy, but where corruption or political inertia is holding it back.
* Identify the forces and alliances that, if mobilized, could break through the corruption/inertia and achieve a political win.
* Mobilize those forces and alliances, again and again, honing your skill over time.
* Generate social and traditional media attention that advances your position, organizing events and building strategic relationships as needed.
* Throughout every stage in this process, you’re constantly looking for ways to use the Internet, politics, PR, and policy to increase the power and efficacy of your small team.
* Recruit additional A-Teams leaders and volunteers as needed.

## What we’re looking for

* You have a strong sense of how state and federal politics works.
* That said, you can think outside the box, see opportunities that others write off, and make new things happen.
* You understand convention but aren’t bound by it.
* You can plug holes, see what’s missing.
* You can get things done, but believe plans are made to break and change.
* You see opportunity to break the status quo of the political process all the time.
* You write beautifully, especially for an online audience.
* Political inside jokes and gossip bore you.
* You get beltway politics, but would rather be speaking to the rest of the country/world.
* You enjoy unplugging from news and Twitter to work on something big.
* You’re a bit of a social chameleon. You feel at home in many circles. You can quickly see how people in a certain scene talk and understand the world, and you can fit right in while still holding on to and spreading your perspective.
* You hold seemingly contradictory political beliefs. Sometimes people on your own political “side” might terrify you, while the other “side” seems more wise.
* You get more excited reading classics of fiction or political theory than watching House of Cards. (House of Cards is not a mortal sin—many of our most respected colleagues do it!—but you’re much broader.)
* You can be crafty and devious. Maybe you were a troublemaker in high school.
* For most of your life you’ve felt compelled to right wrongs or challenge arbitrary authority.
* Your life has intersected with a large political uprising of some kind.
* You’ve maybe been arrested before, for doing something you will never regret.
* You are a fluent English speaker and live in the US.

This is a full time position. Compensation is market rate and commensurate with skills and experience either through a contract rate or a salary (with full health care and dental benefits), depending on what works best for you.

When applying, please include where you heard about the opportunity.

# A-Teams Design Co-founder
## Web designer / front-end developer for high impact political activism.

We are seeking a Design Co-founder for our next “A-Team”, to play a lead role in launching and co-leading a small activist team running a campaign to win on immigrant rights, criminal justice reform, or strengthening democratic representation.

Fight for the Future is known for its new model of activism focused on Internet freedom and has big victories to its credit, such as organizing the protests that defeated SOPA/PIPA, and winning net neutrality rules in 2014.

Our new initiative A-Teams aims to create new, small teams that can achieve surprising political wins on the issue area of their choice, by combining political strategy and Internet savvy.

We are seeking the founding designer / front-end developer for one such “A-Team.” As the designer and technical leader, you will focus one our priority political areas, such as immigrant rights, criminal justice reform, or strengthening democratic representation. You and your A-Team will run a campaign to pass strong policy on your issue or stop a disastrous bill from becoming law. Your role will be to explain complex issues—and get people to take effective political action—using design, copy, and code. We’re looking for someone with very strong visual and interaction design skills who can move from mockups to HTML/CSS, or design directly in code. Experience with modern front-end frameworks is a plus.

You should be comfortable making and launching novel and creative additions to people’s online life with strong use of layout, color, and typography, whether for web, mobile, or social media. You should love the rush of launching a site on a whim, and seeing it blow up in places like Product Hunt, HN, or reddit.

In addition to your design skills you should also have strong political attitudes about power, freedom, fairness, or caring for others that you makes your visual work stronger and more immersive.

You will work alongside a similarly high-functioning and creative person with concrete experience on campaigns so significant experience in politics or activism is not required. The team at Fight for the Future will work with you both to develop and execute plans.

## What you’ll do

* Design and build websites (sometimes straight to code) to tweak and deploy rapidly
* Make images and animation for social media
* Use copy, color, layout, typography and shared visual vocabulary (images, icons, effects) to convey complex political ideas and emotions.
* Build simple forms and sometimes more complex interactions to mobilize people around specific political objectives (i.e. design high-converting landing pages to get people to do stuff!)
* Make awesome moments in the history of the Internet and politics.
* Work closely with the political director to strategize and look for ways to use the Internet and politics to increase the power and efficacy of your small team.
* Build a new organization or movement (if it goes well!)
* Recruit additional A-Teams leaders and volunteers as needed.

## What we’re looking for

* You can write clear instructions, prompts, and documentation.
* You can speak with a strong, authentic, and credible voice online.
* You can design straight to code, when needed.
* Your portfolio site looks great.
* You can make modern forms, buttons and layouts in your sleep.
* You have some experience with animation.
* You can easily grasp what makes a product valuable/awesome and work from there.
* You’re experienced working remotely.
* You quickly understand and internalize what your team or company is driving for.
* You’ve felt compelled to right wrongs or challenge arbitrary authority. Possibly a troublemaker in high school or a handful for your parents.
* You’re purpose-driven so you can pivot easily. Dropping / throwing away work doesn’t bother you, if the new path makes more sense.
* You’re pragmatic and flexible in your habits.
* You intuitively seek the simplest possible solutions, on the fly, and are good at simplifying scope to fit deadlines, saying “no” to features or—even better—“but what if I did it this other, much simpler way?”
* You can dial your design and coding approach between “quick & dirty” and “careful & prudent”, depending on the context.
* You can match styles and technical possibilities (such as an action tool or online stunt) to a given political objective or strategy, and pick the best tech response to a given situation.
* You have a desire to use your skills and smarts to make the world more kind and fair.

## Details:
This is a full time position with Fight for the Future. The salary range is $70-100K annually, depending on experience. Benefits include health care, dental benefits, and training and mentoring with senior staff. If a contract set-up works better for you, we can discuss that too.

This is a remote position and candidates can based anywhere in the US. English fluency is required.
