## Brief

Fight for the Future is a non-profit organization whose mission is to ensure that the web continues to hold freedom of expression and creativity at its core.

Fight for the Future is 100% remote and timezone flexible. Please see below for our current job openings.

# Political Product Director

## A leader in building technology who is ready to organize millions

## ABOUT THE ROLE

Our activism can achieve surprising political wins, by combining political strategy and Internet savvy. The Political Product Director is one of the most important roles in our work. If you ever wanted to build online experiences that reach out, grab people, and help them change the world, then this is the job for you.

## ABOUT YOU

We are seeking someone who can be a leader in building campaigns and technology to make big political change happen. You must know how to direct the creation of websites, tech, and products that can speak to millions. You must have the ability to create products that have the optimism, humor, creativity, and provocation that can resonate with anyone, such as the public or any key constituency you need to move. You should know how to be likeable, harsh, respectful, relaxed, earnest, insistent, serious, epic, comfortable and urgent all at the same time. (In other words: know how to not get tuned out.)

You should also have some political attitudes about power, freedom, fairness, or caring for others that perhaps you have carried with you since your teenage years.

You will work alongside a creative, multidisciplinary campaigning team, including a software developer and a designer, with all of the skills needed to leverage the Internet to reach and organize millions. We’ll work with you to develop and execute plans.

We’re looking for that rare someone who has both a lot of product creativity and a lot of political savvy, but we know that not everyone has had the chance to excel in both areas in the same job (or the same project!). So, if you have a track record in one area but not the other, but think you have the ability and interest to really develop on the side you are lacking experience with, we want to hear from you. The most important things will be creative vision with awareness of emotions and politics (to know where you’re going) impeccable “know it when you see it” taste (to know when you’re not there yet) and some problem solving ability to get from a vision to the final product.

It will probably be hard to do this if you don’t have deep, long-term experiences of some branch of Internet culture, but that might not be necessary. If you can make excellent subway advertisements and landing pages, that might be enough, as long as you’re open to learn. 

## WHAT YOU'LL DO

* Imagine and deliver world-class technology that gives the public a seat at the table, and achieve big political goals.
* Product problem solving: you can synthesize what we need to build (if anything) to most effectively win on an issue and to get there within a changing political environment. 
* Help dream up small and large tech innovations to influence the political process with our development and campaigns team.  
* Reach and organize the public by creating exciting and persuasive content (websites, software, social media, and more) and new realities (such as sign-on letters, events, rallies, protests, alliances, etc.), that can grow fast, generate social and traditional media attention, and advance the debate.
* Coordinate with and direct our team of developers, designers, and campaigners to ensure nimble development of high-quality products and solutions. 
* Respond to political deadlines and climate to influence the debate.
* Prioritize projects, features, infrastructure, and overall development based on political efficacy and resources. 
* Develop product specifications, translate product roadmaps into software development projects and milestones. Implement a process for quality control of our campaigns. 

## WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

Primarily, we need you to be a solid and creative Product Director with the skills to run a political tech shop:

* 3+ years experience developing products for the world, with a strong understanding of current technologies, agile development, security, and industry exposure in software architecture, product design, and delivery.
* Strong UI/UX and design sense that you can use to apply to anything we make. 
* Ability to build user-centered experiences and to evaluate user experiences based on metrics and goals. 
* Someone who can be scrappy when needed and build a shiny MVP that can be ready for showtime in a day for small products and in a matter of weeks or months for bigger projects. 
* Throughout every stage in this process, you’re constantly looking for ways to use the Internet, tech, code, politics, PR, and policy to increase the power and efficacy of our small team.
* You should be able to propose your ideas in drawings, mockups or prototypes, but also work with designers and developers to make the final project just right. (By that we mean: explaining to designers and finding examples, making mockups and tickets for developers, shepherding the process, etc.) 

If you happen to also have a lot of political and cultural awareness, you’re our perfect hire: 

* You have a strong sense of how to bring people together. 
* You can think outside the box, see opportunities that others write off, and make new things happen.
* You write beautifully, especially for an online audience. (English fluency is a must.)
* You understand convention but aren’t bound by it.
* You can plug holes, see what’s missing.
* You can get things done, but believe plans are made to break and change.
* You see opportunity to break the status quo of the political process all the time.
* You fight hard to achieve a goal.

We’re looking for someone smart and savvy and who can be funny and playful with ideas, someone who can speak to people’s humor, fears and what gets them going, someone who can develop purposeful humor, creativity, poignant ideas, and language that can cut through political gridlock and debate.

We’d especially enjoy someone who has a wide interest in pulling off all different kinds of tactics and strategy and using whatever resources are at their disposal—you should have an interest in using law, policies, pop culture, music, philosophy, subcultural themes, memes, language, history, media, organizing playbooks, and whatever else is out there to pull off a really hard-hitting and exciting campaign product for the right audience.

## COMPENSATION

Market Rate / Commensurate with Experience. Full health and Dental benefits. 

## LOCATION

The team will be 100% remote-no need to commute or relocate. Being in the US is a plus. If you’re interested in relocation, let us know. We’d start working with you on a contract basis at an hourly rate, but we will be able to offer full-time position with competitive salary and benefits to the right person.

## TO APPLY
To apply, fill out the application [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2SYlDGFnDblUmqBh6qpyVnaSH-6F80B8DroMEUkFU3fuDtg/viewform) and include where you heard about the opportunity. Show us that you excel at the things we’re looking for. If you like, include links to or samples of products you’ve built and your writing—ideally in situations where you’re working to persuade a group of people to do something with limited space and time. Include as much relevant information as possible: significant things you’ve done, projects you’ve worked on, ideas you’ve brought into the world etc. Being well-rounded is a plus, so don’t exclude significant skills or achievements just because they aren’t activism related (e.g. starting a business, or being a musician).

Also, this might be a useful guide to the typical archetype for this position:

* You’re okay with flux and change and imperfection; you’d rather be working on the highest impact thing than squirrel away on last week’s priorities. 
* Political inside jokes and gossip bore you. You’re rigorous and try to understand frames. 
* You get beltway politics, but would rather be speaking to the rest of the country/world.
* You enjoy unplugging from news and Twitter to work on something big.
* You’re a bit of a social chameleon. You feel at home in many circles. You can quickly see how people in a certain scene talk and understand the world, and you can fit right in while still holding on to and spreading your perspective.
* You hold seemingly contradictory political beliefs. Sometimes people on your own political “side” might terrify you, while the other “side” seems more wise.
* You get more excited reading classics of fiction or political theory than watching House of Cards. (House of Cards is not a mortal sin—many of our most respected colleagues do it!—but you’re much broader.)
* You are curious, crafty, and devious. Maybe you were a troublemaker in high school.
* For most of your life you’ve felt compelled to right wrongs or challenge arbitrary authority.
* Your life has intersected with a large political uprising of some kind.
* You’ve maybe been arrested before, for doing something you will never regret.
* (We know you’re rare, but we know you’re out there.)

# Front-End Software Engineer

## A UX expert and engineer, for defending the Internet

## ABOUT THE ROLE

Fight for the Future is looking for a software engineer to lead the front-end development side of our digital campaigning efforts. This is more than a simple coding or campaigning position. This is a leadership position for someone who understands the threats that face the future of free expression on the Internet, and who can creatively use the Internet as a medium for political change.

## ABOUT YOU

* You’re an excellent front-end coder who can make things work and work well for millions of users.
* You can faithfully implement others’ designs and make good decisions about layout, typography, and color when needed (but you definitely don’t need to be an expert designer or have illustration skills!) 
* You can build high quality user interaction with intuitive prompts, modals, clear buttons, etc, spotting and fixing UI problems as you go.
* You could design straight to code if needed, and while your own design choices don’t have to look fancy or highly polished (authentic is often better!) the result should be crafted, professional and ready to put in front of millions of people.
* You are familiar with current product innovations, messaging apps, social media, UI/UX, and design.
* You understand rapid prototyping and release, user adoption, and A/B testing, and you can navigate cost/benefits analysis of various technical solutions, languages, and architecture-based decisions.
* You can think on your feet, be organized, optimize project plans and workload, and manage/delegate the different pieces of projects.
* You enjoy a fast-paced environment and can pivot quickly as needed to make changes based on changing outside requirements.
* You like brainstorming ways to simplify the scope of a project to fit a given timeline (e.g. if the team asks for something crazy/hard, maybe there’s a much easier way to achieve a similar result) and you’re always looking for those kinds of lovely simplifications.
* You’re happy doing some self-QA and tweaking until a user experience works reliably and feels nice.
* You’re good at thinking into and around a problem, exposing corner cases and potential issues to non-technical collaborators. 

## WHAT YOU'LL be BUILDING

* Flawless HTML/CSS paired with clear, modern design, and intuitive UX to send powerful messages out into the world & apply political pressure in the right places at the right time.
* Modern JavaScript (ES6), build tools (Babel, Gulp, Grunt), and possibly a framework-driven interactive site (React, Angular). These tools are changing rapidly, so learning on the job is encouraged.
* Solutions that achieve our goals by leveraging and customizing existing services (CRM, publishing tools, etc).
* Innovative or unconventional tools to effectively mobilize a large audience.

## THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE ABOUT THIS JOB

* It’s telecommute work with a 100% remote team.
* We do retreats and in-person sprints too, because it’s nice to see people!
* The work will be highly varied, like freelancing on a variety of projects.
* You can choose the framework and tools we use to get stuff done, and use whatever you’re most excited about.
* Be a hero to many. The “yeah, I made that” small talk in bars is fun.

## REQUIREMENTS

* Experience writing modern HTML/CSS with responsive design techniques and awareness of common cross-browser problems.
* An understanding of client-side JavaScript - AJAX, handling events, DOM manipulation and cross-browser compatibility.
* Knowledge of progressive enhancement strategies and ability to create simple sites that can function with JavaScript disabled or seamlessly integrate subtle CSS transitions for a refined user experience.
* Proven ability to do clean and classy design when needed.
* Ability to make good UI/UX decisions and spot problems.

## BONUS POINTS FOR

* Familiarity with static site generators - many of our campaign microsites are built on Jekyll.
* Experience writing modern JavaScript (ES6) and using build tools like Babel, Gulp or Grunt. These tools are changing rapidly, so again, learning on the job is encouraged.
* Experience building front-end applications with a modern framework like React or Angular.
* Having successfully launched a great product working in a small team
* Ability to build and manage teams
* Strong participation in communities like Reddit or HN
* Lots of remote / freelance experience solving problems on tight deadlines
* Persuasive writing skills for an online audience
* Experience working remotely (we use slack/trello/google hangouts)

## MEGA BONUS POINTS FOR

* Having built and marketed your own product.
* Having been a leader—of anything—especially online, especially tech-related
* Experience with activism, resistance, creative and positive troublemaking, or any kind of fiery provocative work in any area.

To apply, fill out the application [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2SYlDGFnDblUmqBh6qpyVnaSH-6F80B8DroMEUkFU3fuDtg/viewform). You'll need to include links to your resume and any public repos, sample code (as many examples as possible) and good examples of HTML/CSS work and UI/UX or design.

# Campaign Strategist / Manager

Our organization is focused on developing high-impact campaigns that resonate with people and help them band together to exert their power. The Campaign Manager/ Manager position is one of the most important roles in our work - it is central to the organization and its effectiveness. If you ever wanted to build online experiences that reach out, grab people, and help them change the world, then this is the job for you. We’re looking for someone to continue to build that organization with us, from the ground up.

We’re looking for someone smart and savvy and who can be funny and playful with ideas; we’re looking for someone who can speak to people’s humor, fears and what gets them going; and we want someone who has purposeful humor and creativity as well as poignant ideas and language that can cut through political gridlock and debate.

We look for people with a rigorous and thought-provoking perspective on a wide range of political issues, and especially on tech and policy. We want you to be a thinker and someone who can synthesize a problem or an idea out of ordinary interaction and frustrations / struggles.

You should be able to think on your feet, be organized, optimize organizational and project plans and work load, manage/delegate the different pieces of a campaign (outreach, press, writing, product) and set up the organization for long term growth. You will also interface with others, so to some extent you should have smart, powerful ideas to share with others. You should understand and be able to express in ways that resonate with your audience the nuances and overarching themes of tech policy, free internet principles, and organizing on the ground and online.

We’d especially enjoy someone who has a wide interest in pulling off tactics and strategy and using whatever resources are at their disposal—you should have an interest in using law, policies, pop culture, music, philosophy, subcultural themes, memes, language, history, media, organizing playbooks, and whatever else is out there to pull off a really hard-hitting and exciting campaign for the right audience.

We’re hiring for senior to mid-level campaigners who have experience with digital or traditional organizing but generally want to innovate to win.

We have several positions, so if you have skills and expertise with just one aspect of campaigning but truly excel at it—from digital growth to on the ground activism—we want to hear from you.

## Desired Skills & Experience

* Writing for a large audience
* Running campaigns on high-impact issues
* Managing campaigns and responses to a fast-changing, dynamic field
* Working with a large variety of people, groups, and companies and spreading the message to as many stakeholders as possible
* Fighting against money in politics and heavily-funded lobbying teams
* Playing a key role in the planning and strategy of campaign organizing and organization growth
* Leading or starting a coalition
* Finding and securing new sources for campaigns

## You should also have experience

* Running online campaigns that grow fast
* Crafting exciting and persuasive actions
* Using online and traditional media to achieve broad visibility (including by talking with press)
* Fighting hard for something

# A-Teams Technical Co-founder
## Full stack developer, product-crafter, troublemaker for a better world. 

Fight for the Future is a small Internet freedom activism team with big victories to its credit, such as organizing the protests that defeated SOPA/PIPA, and winning net neutrality rules in 2014. 
 
Our new initiative [A-Teams](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/ateams/) aims to create new, two-person teams that can achieve surprising political wins in the issue area of their choice, by combining political strategy and Internet savvy.
 
We are seeking the founding technical leader for one such “A-Team.” As the technical leader, you will focus on a political issue, such as climate change, prison reform, health care, or voting rights. You and your A-Team will run a campaign to pass strong policy on your issue or stop a disastrous bill from becoming law. 
 
You should be supremely comfortable making and launching novel and creative additions to people’s online life, whether for web, mobile, or walled gardens like Facebook. You should love the rush of launching something on a whim, and seeing it blow up in places like Product Hunt, HN, or reddit.
 
You should also have strong political attitudes about power, freedom, fairness, or caring for others.
 
You will work alongside a similarly high-functioning and creative person with concrete experience shifting political reality, e.g. a former Congressional staffer, political campaigner, or lobbyist. We’ll work with you both to develop and execute plans. 

## What you'll do

* Make a lot of awesome responsive websites, quickly.
* Creatively use tech to mobilize people around specific political objectives.

* You can speak with a strong, credible voice online.
* You can design in code, whenever you need to.
* Your portfolio site looks great.
* You can make modern forms, buttons and layouts in your sleep.

* You’re experienced working remotely (this position may be remote).
* You quickly understand and internalize what your team or company is driving for.
* You’ve felt compelled to right wrongs or challenge arbitrary authority. Possibly a troublemaker in high school or a handful for your parents. 
* You pivot easily. Dropping / throwing away work doesn’t bother you, if the current path makes more sense.
* You’re pragmatic and flexible in your habits.
* You intuitively seek the simplest possible solutions, on the fly, and are good at simplifying scope to fit deadlines, saying “no” to features or—even better—“but what if I did it this other, much simpler way?”
* You can dial your engineering approach between “quick & dirty” and “careful & prudent”, depending on the context.
* You can match technical possibilities (such as an action tool or online stunt) to a given political objective or strategy, and pick the best tech response to a given situation.
* You have a desire to use your skills and smarts to make the world more kind and fair
* You are a fluent English speaker and live in the US.
 
This is a full time contract position renewed on a monthly basis. Note: since this is a start-up, ongoing funding is not guaranteed, but it’s likely we can provide ongoing funding if your work goes well and demonstrates impact.
 
To apply, please send a **résumé**, links to **samples**, and a **cover letter which explains why you want to do mission-based work** to [ateams@fightforthefuture.org](mailto:ateams@fightforthefuture.org). Please include where you heard about the opportunity.

# A-Teams Design Co-founder
## Web designer / front-end developer for high impact political activism. 

Fight for the Future is a small Internet freedom activism team with big victories to its credit, such as organizing the protests that defeated SOPA/PIPA, and winning net neutrality rules in 2014. 

Our new initiative A-Teams aims to create new, small teams that can achieve surprising political wins on the issue area of their choice, by combining political strategy and Internet savvy.

We are seeking the founding designer / front-end developer for one such “A-Team.” As the designer and technical leader, you will focus on a political issue, such as climate change, prison reform, health care, or voting rights. You and your A-Team will run a campaign to pass strong policy on your issue or stop a disastrous bill from becoming law. Your role will be to explain complex issues—and get people to take effective political action—using design, copy, and code. We’re looking for someone with very strong visual and interaction design skills who can move from mockups to HTML/CSS, or design directly in code. Experience with modern front-end frameworks is a plus.  

You should be supremely comfortable making and launching novel and creative additions to people’s online life with excellent use of layout, color, and typography, whether for web, mobile, or social media. You should love the rush of launching a site on a whim, and seeing it blow up in places like Product Hunt, HN, or reddit.

In addition to your design skills you should also have strong political attitudes about power, freedom, fairness, or caring for others.

You will work alongside a similarly high-functioning and creative person with concrete experience shifting political reality, e.g. a former Congressional staffer, political campaigner, or lobbyist so experience in politics or activism is not required. The team at Fight for the Future will work with you both to develop and execute plans. 

## What you’ll do

* Design and build websites (sometimes straight to code) to tweak and deploy rapidly
* Make images and animation for social media
* Use copy, color, layout, typography and shared visual vocabulary (images, icons, effects) to convey complex political ideas and emotions.
* Build simple forms and sometimes more complex interactions to mobilize people around specific political objectives (i.e. design high-converting landing pages to get people to do stuff!)
* Make awesome moments in the history of the Internet and politics.
* Slowly build a new organization or movement (if it goes well!)

## What we’re looking for

* You can write clear instructions, prompts, and documentation.
* You can speak with a strong, credible voice online.
* You can design straight to code, whenever you need to.
* Your portfolio site looks great.
* You can make modern forms, buttons and layouts in your sleep.
* You have some experience with animation.
* You can easily grasp what makes a product valuable/awesome and work from there.
* You’re experienced working remotely (this position is remote).
* You quickly understand and internalize what your team or company is driving for.
* You’ve felt compelled to right wrongs or challenge arbitrary authority. Possibly a troublemaker in high school or a handful for your parents. 
* You pivot easily. Dropping / throwing away work doesn’t bother you, if the new path makes more sense.
* You’re pragmatic and flexible in your habits.
* You intuitively seek the simplest possible solutions, on the fly, and are good at simplifying scope to fit deadlines, saying “no” to features or—even better—“but what if I did it this other, much simpler way?”
* You can dial your design and coding approach between “quick & dirty” and “careful & prudent”, depending on the context.
* You can match styles and technical possibilities (such as an action tool or online stunt) to a given political objective or strategy, and pick the best tech response to a given situation.
* You have a desire to use your skills and smarts to make the world more kind and fair.
* You are a fluent English speaker and live in the US.

This is a full time contract position renewed on a monthly basis. Note: since this is a start-up, ongoing funding beyond the first month is not guaranteed, but it’s likely we can provide ongoing funding if your work goes well and demonstrates impact.

To apply, please send a résumé, links to samples, and a cover letter which explains why you want to do mission-based work to [ateams@fightforthefuture.org](mailto:ateams@fightforthefuture.org). Please include where you heard about the opportunity.
