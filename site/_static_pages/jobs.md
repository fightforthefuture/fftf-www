More about our work:
Our vision: a world where everyone can access the Internet affordably, free of interference and censorship and with full privacy. To accomplish this, we are using the Internet in innovative ways to mobilize people on a scale previously thought to be impossible. We've built the technology and created the messaging behind the largest online protests in history, including organizing the campaign that defeated SOPA/PIPA, and winning net neutrality rules in 2014. This past year, we garnered over [6 million views](https://www.twitch.tv/fight_for_the_future) while livestreaming the Congressional debate over the Save the Internet Act, generating tens of thousands of phone calls and letters to Congress.

Our model for activism includes the following ingredients: a skilled, nimble team with a fire for political change and an ability to move fast; an uncompromising focus on strategic campaigning and specific wins; a unique approach to campaigning which includes tapping into the power of the Internet; and the ability to speak with a strong voice online.
We’re always open to talking to smart, strategic, and highly creative candidates with significant campaigning or organizing experience. Be in touch if that’s you! Please click on “apply now” below and send along a resume and answer a couple of questions to help us get to know you.
