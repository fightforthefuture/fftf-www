  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>


  <p>Fight for the Future is committed to protecting your privacy. If you sign
    onto one of our various mailing lists, petitions, or use our contact tools,
    we retain the information you provided to primarily manage our mailing
    lists, and secondarily to transmit only the information that is required to
    service providers and public officials when required to submit your
    communications with them. </p>

  <p>We do not sell our email list. We do not share or distribute your contact
    information unless specifically stated so.</p>


  <p>For petitions, open letters, or similar public communications that you've
    signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public
    information. We will not make your street address publicly available, but we
    may transmit it to public officials as part of a petition or open
    letter.</p>

  <p>We may have joint campaigns with cooperating organizations and in those
    cases will explicitly state that we are doing so. In those cases, if your
    information will be shared with another organization in order to facilitate
    email delivery, list management, and other stated purposes, we will
    explicitly make notice on any campaign or website that this organization
    owns before you submit any of your information. If you are submitting your
    information to one of these campaigns or websites, you are opting into the
    sharing of your information for the stated purposes and will be treated as
    so. We will only share information which you submit at the time of notice
    and will not share any person's information obtained from other past or
    future campaigns, knowingly or on purpose.
  </p>

  <p>We sometimes carry out our business or operate our website using third
    party tools or services. Information may be shared with the operators of
    those tools or services in connection with our use of those tools or
    services to carry out business or operate our website.</p>

    card information.
