The bill, which is being commended by <b><a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2018/03/sb-822-would-secure-net-neutrality-california" target="_blank">experts</a>,</b> ensures that Internet service providers (ISPs) operating in the state of California will be prohibited from blocking content, slowing certain sites or services, or charging new fees for users and companies to reach audiences online. It also bans harmful “zero rating” practices that benefit large incumbent companies while harming innovation.</p><p><b>Responding to this morning’s news, Evan Greer, Deputy Director for Fight for the Future (pronouns she/her) had this to say:</b></p><blockquote><p><i>“It’s amazing to see more and more states join the fight for net neutrality, and help fill the massive hole left by the FCC’s reckless repeal. Today’s news from California shows that constituents in the country’s most populous state are deeply concerned about the loss of real net neutrality protections. The fact that state lawmakers have drafted such comprehensive net neutrality protections should send a strong signal to members of Congress who will soon vote on a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to block the FCC’s December repeal. </i></p><p><i>Momentum is growing for net neutrality, as California joins the ranks of states like Montana, Washington, and <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/these-states-are-fighting-for-net-neutrality-is-yours-one-of-them" target="_blank">over a dozen others</a> currently debating what can be done to prevent their residents from ISPs blocking, throttling, and charging them new fees. Internet users and businesses cannot afford to be left unprotected while Congress decides what they’re going to do about the FCC’s deeply unpopular repeal. Thankfully states like California are stepping up, but Congress needs to follow suit and support the CRA to restore protections for all.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Below are resources containing more information on California Senate Bill 822 and other state level-initiatives:</p><ul><li>Full text of <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB822" target="_blank">SB-822 Communications: broadband Internet access service</a>.</li><li><a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2018/03/sb-822-would-secure-net-neutrality-california" target="_blank">Statement from Stanford Professor Barbara van Schewick</a>.</li><li>SF Chronicle: <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Wiener-unveils-revamped-aggressive-net-12750860.php" target="_blank">Wiener unveils revamped, “aggressive” net neutrality bill</a>.</li><li>Fight for the Future: <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/these-states-are-fighting-for-net-neutrality-is-yours-one-of-them" target="_blank">These states are fighting for net neutrality.
