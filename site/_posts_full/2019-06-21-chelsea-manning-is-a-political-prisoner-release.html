We unequivocally condemn the decision to jail her and levy fines against her for mounting a principled opposition to testifying before a Grand Jury. </i></p><p><i>Grand Juries have frequently been used as secretive tools to punish, harass, and entrap activists. There is a long and important history of resisting these acts of government overreach. Chelsea is one of the most principled people I have ever met. Punishing her with more prison time is not going to change her decision –– it will simply cause her more unnecessary suffering. </i></p><p><i>Even if you believe the government’s pretense that they were attempting to coerce Chelsea to testify, there is no longer any reason to hold her now that Julian Assange has been indicted.</i></p><p><i>The US government is blatantly targeting and imprisoning Chelsea Manning due to her political views and outspoken activism. She is a political prisoner. She should be immediately released and the fines against her should be dropped.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Fight for the Future encourages journalists and supporters to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/resistschelsea" target="_blank">@ResistsChelsea</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/xychelsea" target="_blank">@xychelsea</a> for updates.</p><p>### </p>
