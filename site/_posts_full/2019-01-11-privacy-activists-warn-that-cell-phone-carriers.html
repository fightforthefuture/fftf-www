Since then, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon voluntarily announced they will end relationships with third party “location aggregators” in statements to the press. Sprint has so far failed to make a similar commitment.</p><p><b>Responding to this week’s news Fight for the Future Deputy Director Evan Greer (pronouns: she/her) had this to say:<br/></b><br/>“The idea that a cell phone company is selling users’ location data with absolutely no way to opt-out is terrifying. Think about what a stalker, an employer, or a jealous ex could do with access to this kind of information. It&rsquo;s great that the carriers are promising not to sell access to their users’ location data anymore, but we need more than pinky-swears; T-Mobile CEO John Legere <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1009168217586061313" target="_blank">made a promise just like this</a> in June and was just caught breaking it. We’re glad to see that certain senators are <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5z74d/senators-harris-warner-wyden-fcc-investigate-att-sprint-tmobile-bounty-hunters" target="_blank">speaking up</a> about this but, given how much money Congress has taken from the telecom companies, we know they will only take action if we make them. We need a full-fledged federal investigation into what they’ve been up to and who they’ve put at risk. Congress needs to investigate what happened and make this practice illegal as soon as possible.”</p><p>Earlier this week, Fight for the Future launched an <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/stop-the-black-market-for-your-personal-data" target="_blank">online petition</a> demanding a federal investigation into this shady business practice, and is now calling on Congress to ban the sale of sensitive, personal information via strong data protection legislation.</p><p>###</p>
