If public housing units become a panopticon of automated face scanning and monitoring, it will mean more people in prison, more police abuse, and more families torn apart. Surveillance of poor communities isn’t about safety, it’s about social control. Everyone deserves liberty and privacy in their own homes –– no one should have to choose between homelessness and losing their basic rights.”</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Db8ZF8s7s0z4"><iframe width="540" height="304" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8ZF8s7s0z4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure><p>The new bill comes on the heels of growing backlash to facial recognition surveillance that has been spreading across the country. Last week Fight for the Future released <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2019-07-18-new-fight-for-the-future-launches-interactive/" target="_blank">an interactive map</a> showing where in the US facial recognition surveillance is being used, and also where there are local and state efforts to ban it. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco.html" target="_blank">San Francisco</a>, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/06/27/somerville-city-council-passes-facial-recognition-ban/SfaqQ7mG3DGulXonBHSCYK/story.html" target="_blank">Somerville, MA,</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/oakland-bans-facial-recognition-third-us-city" target="_blank">Oakland, CA</a>, recently became the first cities in the country to ban the technology. Berkeley is also <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/21/banning-facial-recognition-oakland-berkeley-could-soon-follow-s-f/" target="_blank">considering</a> a ban, and bills to halt current use of the tech are moving in the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/06/18/voters-back-moratorium-face-recognition-surveillance-mass/eUH62ELtgyvvOjrkcle7tI/story.html" target="_blank">Massachusetts</a> and<a href="https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/07/11/house-bill-would-ban-facial-recognition-technology-in-michigan" target="_blank"> Michigan</a> legislatures. In Congress, there is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/22/blasting-facial-recognition-technology-lawmakers-urge-regulation-before-it-gets-out-control/?utm_term=.0dd175556496" target="_blank">growing</a> bipartisan agreement to address the issue, but it could easily stall under pressure from law enforcement and big tech.<br/></p><p>Fight for the Future opposes attempts by the tech industry and law enforcement to pressure Congress to pass an industry-friendly “regulatory framework” for facial recognition that would allow this dangerous technology to spread quickly with minimal restrictions intended to assuage public opposition. But we support narrower efforts to ban or restrict specifically egregious uses of this surveillance. For more on our position, read <b><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/evangreer/dont-regulate-facial-recognition-ban-it" target="_blank">our op-ed in Buzzfeed News</a>: </b>“Don’t regulate facial recognition. Ban it.”</p><p>###</p>
