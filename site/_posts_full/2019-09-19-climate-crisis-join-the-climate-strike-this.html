<p>The beginning of <a href="https://globalclimatestrike.net/" target="_blank">global climate strike</a> is now only 2 days away. In <a href="https://strikewithus.org/nyc/" target="_blank">New York City</a> it starts noon on Friday at Foley Square with a 1pm march to Battery Park. Even if you cannot stay for the rally at Battery Park, everyone who has a lunch break should just use that to join the march! So: grab a sandwich and join. <a href="https://strikewithus.org/nyc/" target="_blank">Details on the march here</a>. Let’s make this bigger than anyone expects.</p>
