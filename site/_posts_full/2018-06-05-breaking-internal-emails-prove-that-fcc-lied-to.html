The FCC lied to reporters, and to Congress, in order to obscure the fact that they utterly failed to maintain a legitimate public comment process, as they are legally required to do, in their net neutrality repeal proceeding. </i></p><p><i>Overseeing the FCC is Congress’ job. They need to do their job and pass the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to reverse the agency’s illegitimate and unpopular decision. Voters from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly oppose the gutting of net neutrality. No one wants their cable company controlling what they can see and do on the Internet. </i></p><p><i>Inaction is unacceptable. Any member of Congress who remains silent and fails to sign the discharge petition should prepare to face the Internet’s wrath come election time.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Fight for the Future and other groups are <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join" target="_blank">planning</a> mass online actions to coincide with the official date that the FCC repeal goes into effect.</p><p>###</p>
