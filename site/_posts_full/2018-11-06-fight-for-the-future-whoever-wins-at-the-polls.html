In recent weeks, the group has: <br/></b></p><p>* Flooded the Internet with <a href="http://votefornetneutrality.com/selfies" target="_blank">thousands of selfies</a> submitted by voters––including hundreds of first-time voters––telling the world they plan to #VoteForNetNeutrality.</p><p>* Reached millions of people with <a href="http://votefornetneutrality.com/" target="_blank">VoteForNetNeutrality.com</a>, a tool for people to look up where candidates in their area stand and contact their representatives</p><p>* Worked with local activists to deliver a <a href="https://medium.com/@fightfortheftr/we-just-delivered-a-truckload-of-telecom-money-outside-an-anti-net-neutrality-congressmans-9a2e9a2956be" target="_blank">“truckload of telecom money”</a> to Rep Steve Knight (who has not signed on to the CRA despite publicly opposing the FCC repeal) outside a highly publicized debate</p><p>* Launched <a href="http://donatefornetneutrality.com/" target="_blank">DonateForNetNeutrality.com</a>, a major crowdfunding campaign to fund mass online protests and in-district actions during the lame duck session, backed by well-liked web companies and celebrities like Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, actress Evangeline Lilly, and EDM star Bassnectar. <br/></p><p>“Whoever wins at the polls today, when the dust settles and the votes are counted we’ll be mobilizing Internet users to hit the ground running and mount a massive pressure campaign to get Congress to overrule the FCC repeal before they leave office,” <b>said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future (pronouns: she/her),</b> “For those who were re-elected, we’ll show them that we plan to hold them accountable. For those who were unseated, we’ll make this a legacy issue and show them that unless they support the CRA before they leave office, they will go down in history as one of the politicians that helped hasten the death of the free and open Internet.”</p><p>###</p>
