Ant-Man and the Wasp star Evangeline Lilly, legendary guitarist Tom Morello, Tron CEO Justin Sun, author Cory Doctorow, and EDM hero Bassnectar are teaming up with companies like Postmates, Namecheap, and Private Internet Access matching Internet users’ donations to raise money for an epic final push for net neutrality as the deadline approaches for Congress to reverse the FCC’s repeal of open Internet protections.</p><p><b>See the crowdfunding page here: <a href="http://DonateForNetNeutrality.com" target="_blank">DonateForNetNeutrality.com </a></b></p><p>Organizers hope to raise $100,000 to fund mass online protests, crowdfunded ad buys, and strategic in-district organizing pushing for House members to support the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to restore net neutrality before Congress adjourns at the end of the year. The full list of “Internet defenders” who are matching grassroots donations 100%, includes: Bassnectar, Cory Doctorow, Tom Morello, Evangeline Lilly, Private Internet Access, Justin Sun, AnchorFree, iFixit, Lookfar, Namecheap, Pornhub, Postmates, Startpage, Bittorrent, and Tron. </p><p>&ldquo;These folks are taking on the telecom lobby machine and fighting for a free, open, and uncensored Internet,&rdquo; <b>said Tom Morello, </b>&ldquo;Net neutrality is the free speech fight of this generation and time is running out. It&rsquo;s time for the Internet to rise up again.&rdquo;</p><p>“This is not a partisan issue, the battle for the net is a fight for our most basic freedoms. People from across the entire political spectrum can agree that we don’t want anyone to control or manipulate what we see and do on the Internet,” <b>added actress Evangeline Lilly (Lost, Ant-Man and the Wasp, The Hobbit). </b></p><p>“Given my deep belief in an open and decentralized internet, I support Donatefornetneutrality.com and urge others to do the same in this critical moment where Congress can still act in favor of net neutrality,” <b>said Justin Sun, founder and CEO of TRON. </b>“When the internet is free and open, it fosters innovation that benefits not just a few, but all of us. It’s our responsibility to protect these core values and push our community towards the cause.”</p><p>“Net neutrality is not dead yet. Not even close,” <b>said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future,</b> “But time is running out on our best chance to get Congress to save the open Internet and give Ajit Pai the worst day of his political career. Comcast and AT&amp;T’s lobbyists are doing everything they can to make sure Congress adjourns without addressing this. We have to make it something they can’t ignore.”</p><p>###</p>
