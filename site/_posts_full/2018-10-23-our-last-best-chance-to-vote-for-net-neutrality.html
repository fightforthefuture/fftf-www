Weâ€™re in the final crunch before election day and we need to make sure they know there is a massive voting block of people who care about this issue.</p><h2><b>Hereâ€™s what you can do to help out:</b></h2><p>* Get as many net neutrality supporters to vote for the first time as possible.

Mike Coffman, have already signed on. We just need your help to pressure lawmakers to choose their constituents ahead of telecom lobbyists by signing the discharge petition.</p><p><b>Can we <a href="https://votefornetneutrality.com/" target="_blank">enlist you in the Internetâ€™s most important mission</a>?</b>Â Â </p>
