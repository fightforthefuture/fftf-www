While the report is currently being circulated amongst FCC Commissioners and will face a vote for approval in the coming weeks, Commissioner Rosenworcel has already <a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1097975601292468224" target="_blank">taken to Twitter</a> to publicly criticize the reports conclusions. </p><p><b>Responding to yesterday’s fact sheet, Fight for the Future Deputy Director Evan Greer (pronouns: she/her) had this to say:<br/></b><br/>“From what we can see, this report looks like it was written by a telecom lobbyist and bears no resemblance to what Internet users are experiencing in their everyday lives. The fact that the ISP’s <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlBode/status/1098270286250561536" target="_blank">bought-and-paid for mercenaries</a> are lining up to celebrate the report’s findings should tell you everything you need to know—but in case you need more, here are the facts on the ground: U.S. residents are already paying <a href="https://broadbandnow.com/report/2018-fcc-international-data-insights/#note-1477-1" target="_blank">more money</a> for less Internet than nearly anywhere in the world, so it’s awfully strange that the FCC’s <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-356271A1.pdf" target="_blank">media sheet</a> said nothing about price and competition. We hear <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/the-lies-comcast-allegedly-told-customers-to-hide-full-cost-of-service/" target="_blank">story</a> after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/charter-will-spend-less-on-cable-network-in-2019-but-charge-customers-more/" target="_blank">story</a> of people being price-gouged by Internet service providers – most of whom, by the FCC’s own admission, have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/02/fcc-report-finds-almost-no-broadband-competition-at-100mbps-speeds/" target="_blank">zero choice</a> in ISP. Since the FCC’s net neutrality repeal went through, prices have gone up, providers’ own earnings reports show they are <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gyab5m/its-now-clear-none-of-the-supposed-benefits-of-killing-net-neutrality-are-real" target="_blank">not investing</a> more in their networks, fiber deployment has <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/12/new-fcc-data-indicates-future-broadband-access-most-americans-will-be-monopoly" target="_blank">slowed</a>, and telecoms like AT&amp;T are conducting <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nepxeg/atandt-preps-for-new-layoffs-despite-billions-in-tax-breaks-and-regulatory-favors" target="_blank">massive layoffs</a>. Enough is enough. Between the FCC’s misleading report and the GOP’s proposed <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gop-lawmakers-introduce-another-fake-net-neutrality-bil-1832431221" target="_blank">fake net neutrality bills</a>, it’s time for Energy &amp; Commerce Committee Chair Frank Pallone and his Communications and Technology and subcommittee lead Rep. Mike Doyle to take a stand and set things right by introducing strong legislation to restore net neutrality and other consumer protections that the FCC gutted in late 2017.</p><p>Fight for the Future is leading an online campaign asking Congress to restore strong net neutrality protections at BattleForTheNet.com. </p><p>###</p>
