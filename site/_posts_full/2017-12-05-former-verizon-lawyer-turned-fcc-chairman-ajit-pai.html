<p>Verizon-lawyer-turned-FCC-Chairman Ajit Pai is <a href="http://www.iicom.org/events/item/tmf-washington-2017-venueandhotels" target="_blank"><b>speaking</b> </a>at Verizon Headquarters in Washington, DC tomorrow &ndash; just days before a planned vote to gut net neutrality protections that Verizon has lobbied to kill.</p><p><b>The following quote can be attributed to Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future (pronouns: she/her):</b></p><p>&ldquo;This is the kind of corruption that turns your stomach. This is why people <a href="https://app.meltwater.com/icm-web/verizonprotests.com" target="_blank">are protesting</a> at hundreds of Verizon stores and Congressional offices across the country on Thursday, and why more than 750,000 people have called Congress through BattleForTheNet.com. Ajit Pai is an embarassment to his own party and under his leadership the FCC has made a mockery of our democratic process. With a rogue FCC commissioner blatantly captured by the industry he is supposed to provide oversight for, Congress must do their job and take action to stop the FCC vote on December 14.&rdquo;</p><p><br/>Contact:Â 978-852-6457, press@fightforthefuture.org</p><p>###</p>
