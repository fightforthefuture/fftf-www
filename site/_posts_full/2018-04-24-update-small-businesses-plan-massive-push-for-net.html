Small business owners will host delivery <a href="https://www.businessesfornetneutrality.com/#events" target="_blank"><b>events</b></a> at congressional offices across the country, where they will deliver the letter and complete list of signers, and host a short press conference about the impact of losing net neutrality on small businesses.</p><p><b>See the letter here: <a href="https://www.businessesfornetneutrality.com" target="_blank">https://www.businessesfornetneutrality.com</a></b></p><p>To date, nearly 6,000 businesses have signed the letter, including veterinary offices, graphic design shops, restaurants, medical startups, music venues, attorneys, tutoring services, chiropractors, engineering firms, and an amusement park machine supplier. Businesses are being listed publicly on the letter in a rolling fashion as they are verified, and dozens of delivery events are already listed <a href="https://www.businessesfornetneutrality.com/#events" target="_blank"><b>on a map.</b></a></p><p>The nationwide deliveries are supported by a range of groups representing startups and small businesses including the American Sustainable Business Council, Etsy, Patreon, Engine Advocacy, Main Street Alliance, Good Business Colorado, and Small Business Majority, along with digital rights nonprofit Fight for the Future.</p><p>“The loss of net neutrality will hurt all small businesses, not just high tech ones like those I work with,” <b>said Chris Reade President and CEO of Lookfar in New Orleans, LA,</b>  “Without these basic protections, businesses that put food on the table for hard working Americans won’t be able to compete with big corporate giants.”</p><p>“My small business has been able to grow in part because of net neutrality. Strong rules have ensured people can find me and shop my online store,” <b>said Mickki Langston, owner of Tellicherry Trading Company, maker of skincare products in Denver, CO.</b> “Small businesses like mine will be hit the hardest if Internet service providers decide to charge us new fees to reach customers. Everyone in Washington says they support small businesses. I want them to show us that they support small businesses by supporting the CRA.” </p><p>“Our small Alaska-based technology business depends on affordable access to an open, neutral Internet to deliver training, software updates and data to customers around the state,&ldquo; <b>said Julie Olsen, President of OfficeTECH, Inc. in Anchorage, AK.</b> &quot;We need lawmakers to just say “NO” to deep pocketed ISPs plans for fast lanes online and, instead, vote to protect Alaskan businesses and their employees by supporting the CRA resolution to overturn the FCC&rsquo;s repeal and put strong net neutrality protections back in place.</p><p>“Almost everyone who works at Fight for the Future has run a small business at one time in our lives, and we’ve connected with thousands of them through the massive online protests we’ve organized,” <b>said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, who helped coordinate the letter,</b> “without net neutrality, the largest companies will become even more dominant, while family owned businesses, innovative startups, small shops, and freelancers will be squeezed out. It’s a tax on the entire economy for the benefit of a few giant telecom companies.” </p><p>###</p>
