Fight for the Future then provides those members with banners and support with recruitment. More events are being added all the time, so check back before Tuesday if you don’t see one in your area yet.</p><p>Rallies are already planned across the U.S. in small cities like Anchorage, Alaska, and major ones including New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, Palo Alto at Apple’s headquarters, and Boston. Supporters outside the U.S. have planned rallies at Apple stores in Hong Kong and Munich. </p><p>In Washington, DC, protesters <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/458361131032530/" target="_blank">will gather</a> </b>at the FBI’s headquarters, the J. Edgar Hoover building. </p><p>This past Wednesday, after Fight for the Future issued the call for rallies at Apple stores, there was so much interest that they decided to organize one in San Francisco that day on just a few hours notice. Dozens of people turned out to protest the FBI’s position. <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/139516141773/photos-dozens-rally-at-apple-store-in-san" target="_blank"><b>See photos here. </b></a></p><p>“People are rallying at Apple stores because what the FBI is demanding here will make all of us less safe, not more safe,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b>“their unconstitutional attack on our digital security could put millions of people in danger, so we’re giving those people a way to get their voices heard.”</p><p>Fight for the Future senior staff are available for interviews in advance of the Tuesday events, and can connect journalists with Fight for the Future members who are hosting these events in various cities.</p><p>###</p><p><i>Fight for the Future works to defend the Internet as a free and open platform for expression and creativity, and is best known for their role organizing the <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sopastrike.com%2Fnumbers&amp;t=NjgyMTIxYjE4NzBjYTM1MGY1YTMwMTc3ZmUxODlhNDljOWFhZWZlMCw0a01wcUtXQw%3D%3D" target="_blank">massive online protests</a> against SOPA, the <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fbattleforthenet.com%2Finfographic&amp;t=NGJjZmJhYWUyM2Y2MGQwMDhlMjNkODk2ZmI0MjQ3MDVmNjA2NDE3OCw0a01wcUtXQw%3D%3D" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a> for net neutrality, and the <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fresetthenet.org%2F&amp;t=N2FiNjMyZmU5NTQzOTJkZjY0MzY0ZTYxNWY3ZTg0ODBjMDYxOTJkZCw0a01wcUtXQw%3D%3D" target="_blank">Reset The Net</a> campaign for online privacy, which was <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2014%2Fjun%2F05%2Fedward-snowden-privacy-reset-the-net&amp;t=NDViYTA0YWExYzIxMmQ2MzU0NjE4MDVlMWE4YmI1MmFkNjQyNGIzZCw0a01wcUtXQw%3D%3D" target="_blank">endorsed</a> by Edward Snowden.</i><br/></p>
