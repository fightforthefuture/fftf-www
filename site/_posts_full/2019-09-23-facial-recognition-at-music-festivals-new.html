But troublingly, they explicitly left the door open to future use on an “opt in” basis, something security and human rights experts warn does not alleviate the concerns with mass collection of sensitive biometric information. Goldenvoice, who runs Coachella, gave a non-answer “we are not looking to add to this conversation at this time,” when asked to clarify their current policies and future plans regarding the use of facial recognition.</p><p><b>See the scorecard here: <a href="https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/festivals/new/#scorecard" target="_blank">https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/festivals/new/#scorecard</a> </b></p><p>“The companies that run major festivals should not be experimenting on music fans by scanning our faces and collecting our biometric information,” <b>said Evan Greer, Deputy Director of Fight for the Future (pronouns: she/her), </b>“People deserve to know whether their favorite event has plans to use facial recognition technology. Experts say facial recognition is so dangerous it should be compared to nuclear or biological weapons. Festival organizers have a moral imperative to clearly commit to not using this invasive and racially biased technology on music fans. They should never put our safety and basic rights at risk just to collect our data and turn it into profit.”</p><p>Headlining artists like <a href="https://twitter.com/tmorello/status/1171133213403746305" target="_blank">Tom Morello</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/amandapalmer/status/1171100347324162048" target="_blank">Amanda Palmer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/NahkoBear/status/1171154097392635904" target="_blank">Nahko</a> and Medicine for the People, <a href="https://twitter.com/ThieveryCorpDC/status/1171478517030088704" target="_blank">Thievery Corporation</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Gramatik/status/1171146242820333569" target="_blank">Gramatik</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/anti_flag/status/1171144484756893701" target="_blank">Anti-Flag</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/atmosphere/status/1171127265628958721" target="_blank">Atmosphere</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thefader/status/1171435037612376064" target="_blank">Speedy Ortiz</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MelissaFerrick/status/1175005105982201857" target="_blank">Melissa Ferrick</a>, The Glitch Mob, <a href="https://twitter.com/DowntownBoys/status/1171098435711307778" target="_blank">Downtown Boys</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/laurastevenson/status/1171120613144047616" target="_blank">Laura Stevenson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thebrianfallon/status/1171155335479996423" target="_blank">Brian Fallon</a> of Gaslight Anthem, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffrosenstock/status/1171875559120547841" target="_blank">Jeff Rosenstock</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/BDolanSFR/status/1171104044867346434" target="_blank">B Dolan</a> support the campaign, along with thousands of fans who have posted on social media and signed a petition. </p><p>Facial recognition is not widespread at music events in the US.
