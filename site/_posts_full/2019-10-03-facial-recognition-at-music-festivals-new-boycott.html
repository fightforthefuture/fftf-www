On Wednesday, Insomniac Events, producers of blockbuster EDM festivals including Electric Daisy Carnival, Beyond Wonderland, and Okeechobee, issued the same statement. <a href="https://twitter.com/uscevents/status/1171911530486460416" target="_blank">Paradiso Fest</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SONIC_BLOOM/status/1174913828506624000" target="_blank">Sonic Bloom</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SummerMeltdown/status/1171104051322216448" target="_blank">Summer Meltdown</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LucidityFestival/posts/2413149748738084" target="_blank">Lucidity Festival</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/PunkRockBowling/status/1171866472861188096" target="_blank">Punk Rock Bowling</a> posted their commitment to not use the tech publicly. </p><p>Goldenvoice, who runs Coachella as a subsidiary of AEG Presents, explicitly refused to comment when asked to clarify their current policies and future plans regarding the use of facial recognition, saying “we are not looking to add to this conversation at this time.” This non-statement has fueled concerns among activists and music fans that they may be currently experimenting with facial recognition or planning to use it in the future.</p><p>The webpage helps concerned music fans to tweet nine major sponsors, including Pandora, Corona, Coca Cola, Uber, and Bose to ask them to suspend their support until the events make their position clear.</p><p><b>See the webpage here: <a href="https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/festivals/" target="_blank">https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/festivals/</a></b></p><p>“Over the past two weeks, hundreds of fans have used our site to email or tweet AEG Presents events, and we’ve made multiple attempts to contact the organization for a statement,” <b>said Evan Greer, Deputy Director of Fight for the Future (pronouns: she/her). </b>“They are definitely aware that their customers are concerned. Live Nation issued a statement to us two weeks ago, and the longer AEG takes to respond, the more concern grows. People deserve to know whether attending Coachella, Jazz Fest, or any AEG event puts them at risk of having their actions at those events in a permanent government database. Facial recognition, even when used in an opt-in manner, poses serious threats to privacy and civil liberties. It’s systematically misidentifies people of color, exacerbating existing forms of discrimination, and it’s been used by ICE to target undocumented families. AEG should clearly commit to not using this invasive and racially biased technology on music fans. They should never put our safety and basic rights at risk just to collect our data and turn it into profit.”</p><p>Ticketmaster / Live Nation <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2019/09/19/live-nation-facial-recognition-response/" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> confirming that it is not currently using facial recognition at its events, a positive step given that they previously <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59n9yb/musicians-demand-ticketmaster-ban-facial-recognition-at-concerts" target="_blank">invested</a> in the technology. But troublingly, they explicitly left the door open to future use on an “opt in” basis, something security and human rights experts warn does not alleviate the concerns with mass collection of sensitive biometric information. All commitments not to use the technology to date are listed on <a href="https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/festivals/#scorecard" target="_blank">a scorecard</a> on the Ban Facial Recognition website.</p><p>Headlining artists like <a href="https://twitter.com/tmorello/status/1171133213403746305" target="_blank">Tom Morello</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/amandapalmer/status/1171100347324162048" target="_blank">Amanda Palmer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/NahkoBear/status/1171154097392635904" target="_blank">Nahko</a> and Medicine for the People, <a href="https://twitter.com/ThieveryCorpDC/status/1171478517030088704" target="_blank">Thievery Corporation</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Gramatik/status/1171146242820333569" target="_blank">Gramatik</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/anti_flag/status/1171144484756893701" target="_blank">Anti-Flag</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/atmosphere/status/1171127265628958721" target="_blank">Atmosphere</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thefader/status/1171435037612376064" target="_blank">Speedy Ortiz</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MelissaFerrick/status/1175005105982201857" target="_blank">Melissa Ferrick</a>, The Glitch Mob, <a href="https://twitter.com/DowntownBoys/status/1171098435711307778" target="_blank">Downtown Boys</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/laurastevenson/status/1171120613144047616" target="_blank">Laura Stevenson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thebrianfallon/status/1171155335479996423" target="_blank">Brian Fallon</a> of Gaslight Anthem, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffrosenstock/status/1171875559120547841" target="_blank">Jeff Rosenstock</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/BDolanSFR/status/1171104044867346434" target="_blank">B Dolan</a> support the campaign, along with thousands of fans who have posted on social media and signed a petition. </p><p>Facial recognition is not widespread at music events in the US.
