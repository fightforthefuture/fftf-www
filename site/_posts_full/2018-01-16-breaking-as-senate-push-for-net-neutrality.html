Only one more vote needed for CRA to pass Senate and take fight to the House, where there are already more than 80 cosponsors</i></h2><p>Stunning lobbyists, net neutrality supporters are now one vote away from winning a Senate vote on a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to overturn the FCC’s unpopular repeal of net neutrality. All 49 Senate Democrats <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/01/15/the-senates-push-to-overrule-the-fcc-on-net-neutrality-now-has-50-votes-democrats-say/?tid=sm_tw&amp;utm_term=.9bbb09240b56" target="_blank"><b>are now</b></a> co-sponsoring the move, and Susan Collins (R-ME) has <b><a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2018/01/09/politics/susan-collins-angus-king-back-bill-to-reverse-fcc-vote-against-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">said</a> </b>she plans to support it. With victory in the Senate increasingly likely, Internet activists are setting their sights on the House, where they plan to wage a fierce battle to hit the simple majority needed to force a CRA vote to the floor. Today Rep Mike Doyle (PA-14) unveiled the names of 82 original cosponsors of his CRA resolution in the House. Including Doyle, the list totals 83 and includes House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, increasing the chances that House Democrats will line up behind the move. A simple majority is needed to force a vote to the floor in the House.</p><p>“The Internet is on a mission to save net neutrality, and lawmakers that stand in our way will regret it,”<b> said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. </b>“Net neutrality is going to be an election issue in 2018 and every member of Congress knows it. The CRA is steamrolling through the Senate and into the House because lawmakers are reading the writing on the wall that it’s the only viable legislation on the table. Cleanly reversing the FCC’s unpopular and illegitimate decision is, on substance, the correct policy move, and the only one that has support from voters.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Fight for the Future announced a no holds barred campaign at <b><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fvotefornetneutrality.com&amp;t=YWY2ZGFlYzU5NWQ2MWY4YmNkMDFjZDI3NTZkYjdhNDNlNWQzNDUwNyxHWjhmeXJVYQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AKMlLl9GOPd0Y9ROFg2ygww&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.fightforthefuture.org%2Fpost%2F169470508728%2Fbreaking-senate-vote-to-overturn-the-fccs&amp;m=1" target="_blank">VoteForNetNeutrality.com</a> </b>calling on Internet users to pledge to vote against lawmakers who don’t support the CRA resolution to overturn the FCC decision and restore net neutrality protections. The fiercely nonpartisan group is hellbent on restoring net neutrality protections, and willing to target lawmakers of either party if they are not listening to constituents on this critical issue. </p><p>Millions of people have taken action in recent months, bombarding Congress with a flood of phone calls, emails, faxes, tweets, protests, letters from small businesses, and constituent meetings.</p><p><br/>###</p>
