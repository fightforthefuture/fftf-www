We should be dismantling them not expanding them. Agencies like DHS, ICE, and Border Patrol have shown reckless disregard for basic human rights, dignity, and the constitution. We call on Members of Congress to demand that funding not be used to for dangerous technology that violates rights, and to vote against this deal unless changes are made.”</p><p>For info, the deal <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/1096075684143878145" target="_blank">earmarks:</a></p><ul><li>$100 million explicitly for &ldquo;border surveillance technology,&rdquo; including &ldquo;small unmanned aerial systems,&rdquo; meaning drones.
