The measure already passed the Senate last week, so it will now head to the President’s desk for signing.<br/></p><p>Yesterday, digital rights group <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, known for organizing massive protests against SOPA and for net neutrality announced that they will put up <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-03-27-fight-for-the-future-to-unleash-billboards-to/" target="_blank">billboards</a> with the names of every member of Congress who voted to sell off their constituent’s privacy rights.</p><p>“Today Congress proved once again that they care more about the wishes of the corporations that fund their campaigns than they do about the safety and security of their constituents,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. </p><p>“Gutting these privacy rules won’t just allow Internet Service Providers to spy on us and sell our personal information, it will also enable more unconstitutional mass government surveillance, and fundamentally undermine our cybersecurity by making our sensitive personal information vulnerable to hackers, identity thieves, and foreign governments,” she added.</p><figure data-orig-width="1066" data-orig-height="680" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/fc0f3f4f64874df1cc4d4ca882200a2f/tumblr_inline_onjn0ux5HR1ri3xd7_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1066" data-orig-height="680"/></figure><p>The group released a draft <a href="http://imgur.com/a/fN5wy" target="_blank">mock-up</a> of what the initial billboard &ndash; which will be unveiled in Washington, DC and in select districts &ndash; will look like, with the names of the 50 Senators who voted for the bill last week. Today they <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/846758193162260481" target="_blank">tweeted</a> a mock-up of a billboard targeting Rep Marsha Blackburn, who has taken nearly $700,000 in contributions from telecom companies over her career. </p><p>“Congress should know by now that when you come for the Internet, the Internet comes for you,” Greer added, “these billboards are just the beginning. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, and every lawmaker who votes to take away our privacy will regret it come election day.”</p><p>The public backlash following the party-line vote in the Senate clearly had an impact, as 15 Republicans broke ranks to vote against the controversial measure.</p><p>By using the CRA to gut the FCC broadband privacy rules, lawmakers voted to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections" target="_blank">allow</a> ISPs to:</p><p>-Monitor and sell customer’s location data, search history, app usage, and browsing habits to advertisers without your permission</p><p>-Hijack customer’s search results, redirecting their traffic to paying third parties<br/></p><p>-Insert ads into web pages that would otherwise not have them</p><p>Fight for the Future was instrumental in the massive grassroots campaign that successfully pushed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enact the strongest net neutrality protections in US. history last year.
