Massive online mobilization got us the strong net neutrality protections that we have now, and we intend to fight tooth and nail to defend them. Politicians in Washington, DC need to learn that net neutrality is not a partisan issue and Internet users will not tolerate these attacks on our basic rights &ndash; we will come together to protect the web as an open platform for free expression and exchange of ideas.”</p><p><b>Michal Rosenn, General Counsel at Kickstarter, said: </b>“A threat to net neutrality is a threat to the free exchange of ideas that creative culture and an informed public rely upon. Kickstarter, and the tens of thousands of creators who have brought new ideas to life through our platform, all depend on a free and open internet. We&rsquo;re proud to stand alongside so many others today to preserve net neutrality, and to protect the freedoms that make the internet such a powerful force.”</p><p><b>Malkia Cyril, executive director at the Center for Media Justice, said: </b>&ldquo;Communities of color across the United States depend on an open Internet to thrive. From resisting police violence to demanding fair wages &ndash; the political voice and economic opportunity that the Internet enables must remain protected by Title II net neutrality. Trump&rsquo;s FCC seeks to wall these communities off from the power of the internet as a mobilizing tool and an equalizer. On July 12, we will stand together with activists, Internet users of color, advocacy groups, and tech companies to preserve democracy by defending our Internet.”</p><p><b>Michael Cheah, General Counsel, Vimeo, said:</b> “Net neutrality made it possible for Vimeo, along with countless other startups, to innovate and thrive. The FCC’s proposed rollback of the 2015 open Internet rules threatens to impede that innovation and allow a handful of incumbent ISPs to determine winners and losers. On July 11th, Vimeo will proudly join our fellow tech brethren to rally Internet users nationwide to demand strong net neutrality rules to prevent ISPs from manipulating Internet traffic.”</p><p><b>Mark Stanley, communications director of Demand Progress, said: </b>“The FCC&rsquo;s plan to dismantle net neutrality will unfairly pad the bottom lines of Comcast and the rest of Big Cable, while undermining the public’s ability to freely communicate, organize, and innovate. Every few years, a threat so severe confronts the open internet that people, organizations, and companies from across the political spectrum—including some of the largest online platforms—must band together in common cause to fight back. The FCC’s ongoing effort to roll back net neutrality protections represents just such a threat — and on the July 12th day of action, we’ll once again use the transformative power of the internet to defend the internet itself.”</p><p><b>Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator, said: </b>&quot;At Y Combinator, the startup accelerator I run, we have proudly supported thousands of entrepreneurs and more than 1,400 businesses, including companies like AirBnB and Dropbox. Companies like these have gone on to change our lives for the better—how we work, how we eat, how we live. They could grow and compete, and ultimately consumers choose who wins and loses online. Without strong net neutrality rules, though, I’m concerned that the cable and wireless companies that control internet access will have outsized power to pick winners and losers in the market.&rdquo;<br/></p><p><b>Free Press Campaign Director Candace Clement said:</b> “It’s like déjà vu. The last time Net Neutrality came before the FCC, internet users across the political spectrum swamped the agency with comments demanding strong Net Neutrality protections. The internet won’t go down quietly in 2017 and on July 12 people, companies, organizations and websites will let everyone know that the Trump FCC lacks a public mandate to take away our online rights. We will make it impossible for Chairman Pai to continue to cling to the sorts of alternative facts against Net Neutrality that we’ve proven to be wrong time and again.”</p><p><b>Denelle Dixon, Mozilla&rsquo;s Chief Legal and Business Officer, said:</b> &ldquo;Net neutrality is vital to a healthy Internet: it protects free speech, competition and innovation online. It&rsquo;s also something a majority of Americans support — 76%, according to a recent Mozilla-Ipsos poll. By reverting to a Title I classification for ISPs, the FCC is endangering Americans&rsquo; access to a free and open web. The FCC is creating an Internet that benefits ISPs, not users.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Zachary Rosen, CEO of Pantheon, said:</b> &ldquo;We started Pantheon to make it easier for organizations big and small to succeed on the Web. But if strong net neutrality rules under Title II go away, it&rsquo;d put both us and our customers&rsquo; innovation at risk.” </p><p>###</p>
