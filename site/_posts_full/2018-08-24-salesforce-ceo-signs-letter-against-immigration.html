<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 8/24/2018<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/business/trump-immigration-business-leaders-economy.html" target="_blank">signed</a> an open letter with other tech company executives condemning the Trump Administration’s immigration policies, saying that they hurt the U.S. economy. But the statement feels a bit empty, given that Salesforce is continuing to maintain a multimillion dollar contract with US Border Patrol, the government agency carrying out many of the abuses the CEO letter denounces.<br/></p><p>Fight for the Future, a digital rights organization, has been running a campaign at <a href="http://dropsalesforce.com" target="_blank"><b>DropSalesforce.com</b></a>, calling on Salesforce to cut ties and stop supporting human rights violations. The group is crowdfunding ads and calling on speakers to pull out of Salesforce’s flagship yearly conference, Dreamforce. </p><p>“Signing this letter is the ultimate hypocrisy,” <b>said Jelani Drew, campaigner with Fight for the Future, </b>“Marc Benioff can condemn immigration policies and attempt to donate to immigration nonprofits all he wants, but until he drops his company’s contract with Border Patrol, he is actively providing technology to enable the same abusive policies he is condemning. It’s time for Benioff to put his money where his mouth is and cancel the contract. Until then, his signature on this letter is a slap in the face to those affected by these inhumane policies.”</p><p>###</p>
