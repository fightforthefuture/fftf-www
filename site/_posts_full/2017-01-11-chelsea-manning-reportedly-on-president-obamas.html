Chelsea won’t survive another 5 years in prison, much less another 30. President Obama has 9 days to do the right thing and commute her sentence. The world is watching, and we hope that he stands on the side of justice, and that his legacy will be one of standing up for trans people’s rights, not having extinguished one of our community’s brightest lights.”</p><p><b>Chelsea’s Appellate Counsels Nancy Hollander and Vincent Ward said:</b></p><p>“As Chelsea&rsquo;s appellate counsel we urge President Obama to act now and commute her sentence to time served. Her appeal will take years. It is past time to start caring for a Soldier who stood up for all of us.”<br/></p><p><b>Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, said:</b></p><p>“Chelsea Manning is a compassionate, thoughtful, brilliant human being whose actions have always been motivated by the same thing: her desire to help people and make the world a better place. She has suffered enough. President Obama should act now to right this wrong before it’s too late.” </p><p>If the <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/army-leaker-chelsea-manning-obama-s-short-list-commutation-n705441" target="_blank">NBC News report</a> is accurate and President Obama moves to commute Manning’s sentence, he will be responding to overwhelming public outcry about Chelsea’s mistreatment while incarcerated.</p><p>-More than 100,000 people signed an official <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/commute-chelsea-mannings-sentence-time-served-1" target="_blank">Whitehouse.gov petition</a>, meeting the threshold to require a response from the President.<br/></p><p>-Hundreds of thousands have <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/148748864883/photos-chelsea-manning-supporters-deliver-more" target="_blank">signed</a> previous <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/126992085883/photos-chelsea-manning-supporters-deliver-100000" target="_blank">petitions</a> organized by Fight for the Future and other groups decrying Chelsea’s treatment while in prison<br/></p><p>-The ACLU and more than a dozen prominent LGBT organizations <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-and-lgbt-groups-call-obama-grant-clemency-chelsea-manning" target="_blank">sent a letter</a> to President Obama calling for Chelsea’s commutation<br/></p><p>-Amnesty International <a href="https://www.freechelsea.com/amnesty-international/" target="_blank">sent a letter</a> to President Obama, and supporters <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/actions/obama-free-chelsea-manning-now" target="_blank">sent over 25,000 emails</a> to the White House</p><p>-Dozens of other human rights, free speech, government transparency, and civil liberties organizations have called for Chelsea’s release</p><p>-A wide range of notable people have publicly supported Chelsea including Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Morris C.
