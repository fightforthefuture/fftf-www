But when you sift through all the noise, fake comments, bots, and BS you always find the truth: no one wants their cable company to charge more fees and control what they see and do on the Internet.</p><p>Under Ajit Pai’s leadership, the FCC sabotaged its own comment process in a cynical attempt to discount overwhelming public outcry. But despite the confusion sewed by astroturf campaigns, fraudulent comments, and a phony DDoS attack peddled by the agency’s staff, study after study after study has confirmed the same thing: an overwhelming majority of people from across the political spectrum support net neutrality and oppose the FCC’s repeal.</p><p>Sitting members of Congress who have not signed the discharge petition to restore net neutrality had better take note: there is a massive voting block of people who care about this issue and you’re running out of chances to get this right. Vote for net neutrality before November 6th or be prepared to pay the price at the polls.</p><p>###</p>
