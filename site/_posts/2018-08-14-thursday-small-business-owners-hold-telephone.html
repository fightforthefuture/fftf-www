Without net neutrality protections, Internet service providers can charge small businesses exorbitant new fees for privileged “fast lane” access to customers online. This amounts to a new tax on businesses across the country, and would significantly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/net-neutrality-small-businesses.html" target="_blank">undermine</a> the Internet as a level playing field for commerce.</p><p>In May the Senate passed the CRA in a historic <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/16/net-neutrality-is-getting-a-big-vote-in-the-senate-today-heres-what-to-expect/?utm_term=.cb601d42ec63" target="_blank">bipartisan vote</a> of 52-47, including support from GOP Senators Murkowski (AK), Collins (ME) and Kennedy (LA). Its companion in the House currently has 177 signers including GOP <a href="https://gizmodo.com/first-republican-joins-u-s-house-effort-to-restore-net-1827663078" target="_blank">Rep Mike Coffman</a> (CO-6). The CRA is the only measure that can restore meaningful net neutrality rules during this Congress. A new <a href="https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/survey-net-neutrality-could-be-midterm-issue?docId=Fza61iU8a7fO5TFOAslmxyS3qDk" target="_blank">poll</a> conducted by IMGE Insights shows that net neutrality will influence a majority of voters in the upcoming election cycle.</p><p>###</p>
