Even worse, all of these members have opposed fixing the “backdoor search” loophole, through which the government searches specifically for U.S. persons without a warrant.</p><p>“We are Democratic lawmakers who believe that the best future for our children is an Orwellian dystopia where governments have absolute control over their citizens&rsquo; thoughts and actions through pervasive mass surveillance. That&rsquo;s why we support the reauthorization of Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act,” the page mockingly states, listing Congress members <b>Adam Schiff (D-CA)</b>, <b>Angus King (I-ME)</b>, and <b>Mark Warner (D-VA)</b> as “members” of a faux organization, <b><a href="http://democratsforafascistdystopia.org" target="_blank">“Democrats for a Fascist Dystopia.”</a></b></p><p>Under the heading ‘Our Mission,’ the page continues: “Our goal is to reauthorize Section 702, which would let Donald Trump - and any future president - engage in warrantless monitoring and mass collection of Internet and telephone communications.”</p><p>A “Who we are” section of the site pairs real quotes from each lawmaker about Donald Trump with satirical endorsements of Trump’s potential use of Section 702 surveillance powers.</p><p>“Mass surveillance doesn’t work. It’s not about public safety—it’s about government control,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, the group behind the page.</b> “In these times it’s unconscionable for any lawmaker that claims to care about free speech or human rights to support the reauthorization of warrantless surveillance of Americans under Section 702,” <b>she added.</b></p><p>Fight for the Future is encouraging its 1.4 million+ members to oppose any legislation that reauthorizes Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act without closing the backdoor loophole. If Congress fails to secure this necessary minimum, supported even by Senator Feinstein, a long-time surveillance hawk, members of Congress should let this unconstitutional law expire at the end of the year..</p><p>###</p>
