Once that happens, it will move to a vote at the FCC’s open meeting in December, and it will become much much harder to stop him.</p><p>It’s clear that the FCC remains set on killing net neutrality. But Congress can stop the FCC from gutting the rules that keep the web open, affordable, and awesome.</p>
