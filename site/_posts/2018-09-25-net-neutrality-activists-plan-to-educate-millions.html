The campaign makes use of cutting edge mobile technology, including a chatbot flow that allows Internet users to register to vote, sign up for voting reminders, and find out where candidates in their area stand on net neutrality, all from their phones using SMS messages. </p><p>Participants will be encouraged to focus their collective energy to pressure sitting members of Congress in tight races who have failed to take action to restore net neutrality and are facing off against challengers who say they would do so were they elected. Local action teams in key districts are planning protests, lawn signs, and voter education at the polls. Internet users who don’t live in one of the priority districts will be encouraged to join a volunteer texting team to educate as many voters in those districts as possible about where the candidates stand before they head to the polls. </p><p>“Net neutrality is going to be an issue in the 2018 elections,” <b>said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, </b>“We’re harnessing the power of the Internet to educate voters on a mass scale and turn up the heat on sitting members of Congress to do the right thing or face the consequences in November. We’ll make sure that every sitting member of Congress knows that if they ignore their constituents on this issue and side with some of the most power hungry and unpopular corporations in the world, their constituents will know about their betrayal when they go to the polls.”</p><p>###</p>
