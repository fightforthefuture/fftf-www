The world needs people like her now more than ever.</i></p><p><i>Chelsea’s release is a victory for transparency, democracy, and freedom of expression. It’s a victory for human rights and for LGBTQ people in prison. And it’s a testament to the power of grassroots activism.</i></p><p><i>Hundreds of thousands of people spoke out in support of Chelsea through petitions, protests, and online campaigns. She has inspired so many of us with her limitless passion and drive to make the world a better place, speak truth to power, and help others.</i></p><p><i>Fight for the Future is honored to have played a role in helping secure Chelsea Manning’s freedom. We thank all of our supporters who took action to defend her basic rights and draw attention to the government’s inhumane treatment of this brave woman, who was held in conditions that the United Nations condemned as torture. </i></p><p><i>As for me, I just can’t wait to finally meet Chelsea face to face, and give her a hug.”</i></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a> is a digital rights and free speech non-profit best known for organizing some of the largest online protests in history against online censorship and surveillance, and in support of net neutrality.
