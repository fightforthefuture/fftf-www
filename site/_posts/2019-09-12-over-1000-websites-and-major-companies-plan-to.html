Many of these largest websites in the world are participating, such as Imgur, Tumblr, and Wordpress, by spreading the word on social media, donating ad space, or putting banners on their websites to announce the strikes. Some companies, like Burton and Patagonia, will be taking more aggressive action, such as shutting down both their physical and online stores on September 20th and encouraging employees and customers to strike.</p><p><b>Websites can join by contacting Fight for the Future or by visiting the campaign landing page. <a href="http://digital.globalclimatestrike.net" target="_blank">See the landing page for the campaign here.</a></b></p><p>“From the SOPA blackout to net neutrality we’ve used the Internet to mobilize people on an unprecedented scale to achieve grassroots victories that were previously thought to be impossible,” <b>said Evan Greer, Deputy Director of Fight for the Future</b>, a digital rights organization that has been working with an ad hoc coalition of environmental groups, tech workers, and others to organize the Digital Climate Strike. “Politicians and lobbyists want us to think that solving the climate crisis is impossible. We need to channel the power of the Internet to turn the impossible into the inevitable. Our future depends on it.”</p><p>Youth around the world have been striking from school on Fridays, demanding action to stop the global climate crisis. These youth are calling for a mass mobilization on Friday, September 20th — three days ahead of a United Nations emergency climate summit — to move world governments to take emergency action and end the fossil fuel era. Over 1,700 strikes are planned in more than 150 countries to disrupt business as usual, and strikers are calling on everyone to join them.</p><p>While some companies, like Seventh Generation, Patagonia, and Atlassian are encouraging their employees to participate in the global strikes, many of the largest companies like <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/wired-awake-100919" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> and Amazon have stayed silent. In response, their workers, however, have taken on their own initiative to walk out on September 20th to demonstrate their solidarity with youth strikers. In the case of Amazon, at least part of their action is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-walkout-climate-change/" target="_blank">directed</a> at the company itself for its inaction to address the climate crisis. </p><p>&ldquo;Climate change is the greatest crisis humanity has ever faced, and it will affect our generation the most,” <b>said Alexandria Villaseñor, school striker and founder of Earth Uprising.</b> “That&rsquo;s why at the global climate strike on September 20th, youth must lead the way and demand climate action NOW from our world leaders!&rdquo;</p><p>“This is the tipping point. Today’s youth are not fooled: their futures are being stolen before their very eyes by the fossil fuel industry and corrupt politicians. We’re joining them because we refuse to be bystanders while our children are left with an unlivable planet by our inaction,” <b>said Shuo Peskoe-Yang, with Fight for the Future.</b> “There is no room for neutrality. The children are calling on us, and the time to act is now.”</p><p>“Climate change is affecting everyone and it’s imperative that we continue to create and push those conversations,” <b>said Bridget Kyeremateng, Tumblr’s Social Impact Lead.</b> “Tumblr’s passionate and driven community is always eager to find ways that they can get involved in their communities and the Climate Strike is a great opportunity to take issues off the platform and onto the streets.” </p><p>&ldquo;In the digital era, the internet has democratized the connection between people all over the world. Similarly, the climate crisis also knows no borders. It affects everyone and is now the most urgent challenge of our time,&rdquo; <b>said Sarah Wilbore, Digital Engagement Director at 350.org. </b>&ldquo;We only have a few years to change things, and this will only be possible with participation and pressure from everyone: civil society, business and governments. We have a joint responsibility to contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and we can’t delay any further, it must start now.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Climate change is disrupting business as usual for everyone. It doesn’t matter what industry you’re in or how big your organization is. Our team cares deeply about this and our clients rely on us for responsible technology,&rdquo; <b>said Tim Frick CEO of Mightybytes. </b>&ldquo;Participating in the digital strike is one way for Mightybytes to let people know that addressing climate change is a priority for us.&rdquo;</p>
