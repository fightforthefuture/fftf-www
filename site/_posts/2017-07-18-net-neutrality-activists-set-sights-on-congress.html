The congressional scorecard makes it easy for voters to quickly learn their representative’s positions, and impossible for members of Congress to hide from their constituents. </p><p><b>See the crowdfunding page for the billboards here: <a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/campaigns/nnbillboards/#page-1" target="_blank">https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/campaigns/nnbillboards/#page-1</a> </b></p><p><b>See the congressional scorecard here: <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/#scoreboard" target="_blank">https://www.battleforthenet.com/#scoreboard</a></b> </p><p>“Internet users are pissed off and paying attention,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b>“Any lawmaker that stands idly by and allows the FCC to gut these basic free speech protections that people from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly support will be seen as an enemy of the Internet and an enemy of free speech. These billboards, and the scorecard, are just the beginning.” </p><p>The group plans to initially put up billboards targeting House GOP leadership members who used a meeting last week <b><a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/341867-house-republican-leadership-cautions-tech-on-net-neutrality-report" target="_blank">to threaten</a> </b>tech companies who were participating in the historic net neutrality day of action on July 12<b> <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-07-13-update-historic-day-of-action-for-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">which drove</a> </b>millions of comments, emails and phone calls to decision makers, and saw broad participation from every corner of the Internet from major web platforms, startups, YouTubers, gamers, and forums like 4chan and reddit. The billboards will also mention lawmakers vote to gut Internet privacy rules that prevent ISPs from collecting and selling customer information to advertisers.</p><p>The <b><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/#scoreboard" target="_blank">congressional scorecard</a> </b>divides Congress into two camps: Team Internet (those who are speaking up to defend net neutrality rules that protect online free speech) and Team Cable (those who are supporting the FCC’s plan to dismantle those protections and give Cable companies control over our online experience.) Lawmakers on “Team Cable” should expect to be targeted with billboards in the coming weeks if they do not speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan. </p><p>The announcements of both the billboards and scorecard come as all eyes shift to the Senate where Ajit Pai is expected to be confirmed as commissioner this week in a largely procedural vote. </p><p><b>Background on the historic July 12 net neutrality day of action: </b></p><p>Nearly all of the most popular websites on the web participated in a historic Internet-Wide <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/july12" target="_blank">Day of Action</a> to Save Net Neutrality on July 12, 2017 to oppose the FCC’s plan to slash Title II, the legal foundation for net neutrality rules that protect online free speech and innovation. A flood of web platforms small and large like Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, Spotify, 4chan, Airbnb, Amazon, Mozilla, OK Cupid, Vimeo, Tinder, Expedia, Pornhub, Imgur, Yelp, Spotify, and Soundcloud &ndash; along with a vast array of online communities from every corner of the Internet: gaming forums, YouTube creators, subreddits and more &ndash; displayed prominent protest messages to their users, encouraging them to take action by contacting the FCC and Congress through tools like <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a> that make it easy for Internet users to make their voices heard. </p><p><b>See PHOTOS, IMAGES, and DESCRIPTIONS of how participants are protesting here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/vYVet" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/vYVet</a> </b></p><p><b>SEE A SAMPLING OF VIDEO COMMENTS here: <a href="https://vimeo.com/225341994/852009671a" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/225341994/852009671a</a></b> </p><p>There was so much activity on this day that organizers are still in the process of documenting and compiling it, but here are some initial numbers showing the scale of this massive event:</p><ul><li>Tens of millions of people saw the protest messages on participating websites</li><li>Over 5 million emails to Congress (which will be delivered over coming days)</li><li>More than 2 million comments to the FCC (nearly tripling our Sept. 10th 2014 “Internet Slowdown” record for most in a single day)</li><li>More than 125,000 phone calls to Congress</li><li>#NetNeutrality trended on both Facebook and Twitter</li><li>Protesters went in person to more than 20 Congressional offices </li><li>More than 125,000 websites, people, artists, online creators, and organizations signed up to participate in the initial call to protest</li><li>Celebrities flocked to support the effort including <a href="https://twitter.com/PearlJam/status/885230542576205824" target="_blank">Pearl Jam</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Wilco/status/885233478719221762" target="_blank">Wilco</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PearlJam/status/885230542576205824" target="_blank">Wil Wheaton</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TimRobbins1/status/885154464432136192" target="_blank">Tim Robbins</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SusanSarandon/status/885196657792516097" target="_blank">Susan Sarandon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/blues_traveler/status/885242752656605184" target="_blank">Blues Traveler</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenfry/status/884942083252920320" target="_blank">Steven Fry</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkRuffalo/status/885098668910444544" target="_blank">Mark Ruffalo</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraJaneGrace/status/885226732369960964" target="_blank">Laura Jane Grace</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kendrick38/status/885159414902042628" target="_blank">Kendrick Sampson</a>, <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/07/ted-leo-and-amanda-palmer-explain-why-we-need-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">Amanda Palmer</a>, <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/07/ted-leo-and-amanda-palmer-explain-why-we-need-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">Ted Leo</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/FullFrontalSamB/status/885257665924018176" target="_blank">Samantha Bee</a>, and many more.</li><li>Broad participation from every corner of the Internet: from online gaming communities to librarians to real estate sites to grassroots organizations to independent musicians. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/vYVet" target="_blank">See a gallery here.</a></li><li>Facebook, Google, and Dropbox three of the largest Internet companies, came out publicly with strong statements in support of the current FCC rules.

It’s a grassroots effort involving dozens of volunteers working together in Slack channels, outreach spreadsheets, endless email chains, organizing in online communities and forums, and an enormous amount of creativity and digital elbow grease. </p><p>The list of sites and apps participating has grown so quickly it’s almost impossible to keep up, but participants include Automattic (Wordpress), eBay, Rosetta Stone, Pinterest, Amazon, Mozilla, Netflix, Etsy, Kickstarter, Soundcloud, Dropbox, Spotify, Redfin, Facebook, Google, Snapchat, Medium, Y Combinator, GitHub, Pantheon, Opera, Bittorrent Inc., Shapeways, Nextdoor, Stack Overflow, Funny Or Die, Dreamhost, and CREDO Mobile, Goldenfrog, Fark, Chess.com, Namecheap, DuckDuckGo, Checkout.com, Sonic, Ting, ProtonMail, O’Reilly Media, SlashDot, Dribble, Dischord, SourceForge, and Union Square Ventures. Organizations participating include Fight for the Future, Free Press Action Fund, Demand Progress, Center for Media Justice, EFF,  Internet Association, Internet Archive, World Wide Web Foundation, Creative Commons, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Greenpeace, Common Cause, ACLU, Rock the Vote, American Library Association, Daily Kos, OpenMedia, The Nation, PCCC, MoveOn, OFA, Public Knowledge, OTI, Color of Change, MoveOn, Free Software Foundation, Internet Creators Guild, the Women’s March, and many others.</p><p>###</p>
