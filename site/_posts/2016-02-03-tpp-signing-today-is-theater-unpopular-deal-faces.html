<h2><i>Fight for the Future statement on signing of Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, which threatens Internet freedom, democracy, and free speech</i></h2>
<p>Today, leaders from 12 countries will gather in New Zealand to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The act is largely ceremonial&ndash;&ndash;before the deal can become law it must be ratified by each country&rsquo;s legislature, including U.S. Congress where it faces fierce opposition from both left and right. </p>
<p>Protesters gathered in front of the White House today ahead of the signing with signs reading &ldquo;TPP = Betrayal&rdquo; and &ldquo;TPP would kill the Internet.&rdquo; <b><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/138618145588/photos-protest-at-white-house-today-ahead-of-tpp" target="_blank">See photos here.</a> </b>More protests are planned across the country tomorrow. <b><a href="http://www.flushthetpp.org/nationwide-mobilization-to-stop-the-tpp-off-to-a-strong-start/" target="_blank">See list of actions in 38 cities here.</a></b> </p>
