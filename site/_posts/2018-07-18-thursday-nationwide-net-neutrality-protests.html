Constituents will rally with signs and banners, and then deliver an <a href="http://businessesfornetneutrality.com" target="_blank">open letter</a> signed by thousands of small businesses calling on Congress defend net neutrality. </p><p><b><a href="https://medium.com/@fightfortheftr/photos-net-neutrality-protests-at-congressional-offices-nationwide-af2990c610a8" target="_blank">UPDATE: see photos from the events here.</a></b></p><p><b>See a map and list of volunteer-led events here: <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/map" target="_blank">battleforthenet.com/map</a></b></p><p>The protests come amid growing outcry for Congress to act to reverse the FCC’s resoundingly unpopular repeal of net neutrality protections, which officially went into effect on June 11th. Rep Mike Coffman (R-CO) just became the first GOP member of the House of Representatives to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution that would reverse the FCC’s decision, creating massive pressure for other members of Congress to follow suit. </p><p>Net neutrality rules prevent Big Cable companies like Comcast and Verizon from controlling what we see and do on the Internet with throttling, censorship, and extra fees. These protections ensure free speech online, and are especially essential for small businesses, who can’t afford ISP’s pay-to-play schemes. More than 6,000 small businesses have signed an open letter at <a href="http://businessesfornetneutrality.com" target="_blank">BusinessesForNetNeutrality.com</a>, which will be delivered to Congressional staffers during the events on Thursday.</p><p>###</p>
