The page highlights <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/05/ticketmaster-invests-in-a-facial-recognition-technology-company/" target="_blank"><b>the fact</b></a> that Ticketmaster / Live Nation has invested in a partnership with a company that makes facial recognition software, but the campaign calls on music festivals and promoters to commit to not using this invasive technology on fans.</p><p>Yesterday, a Live Nation representative <b><a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/59364-facial-recognition-music-festivals" target="_blank">told a reporter</a> </b>that Fight for the Future’s campaign is “misinformation,” and claimed that they had reached out to Fight for the Future to clarify their position. <b>Today we can confirm that this is false.</b> Fight for the Future has not received any communications from Live Nation about their investment in facial recognition technology, or their future plans to use it. </p><figure data-orig-width="746" data-orig-height="382" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/b08b322d0729818f39eeb085dd808ea4/63959a31c0c495a6-da/s540x810/1c0311443be0e51a35dfcaf4e977ae14490f416b.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="746" data-orig-height="382"/></figure><p>“It’s funny, I get a lot of spam emails from Live Nation about buying overpriced tickets for concerts that I’m not interested in, but I haven’t gotten a single email from them about this campaign, even though they’re telling reporters they’ve reached out to us,” <b>said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future. </b></p><p>Live Nation / Ticketmaster also shared this statement with reporters:</p><figure data-orig-width="727" data-orig-height="168" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff5b4bc68daafcf311eb5f39b0c3381d/63959a31c0c495a6-dc/s540x810/25c87857a5985c9e44c344c01ee9c6630e53a43e.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="727" data-orig-height="168"/></figure><p><b>Fight for the Future has the following response, which can be attributed to its Deputy Director, Evan Greer: </b></p><blockquote><p>“This is exactly the same talking point that we&rsquo;re getting from the airline industry. If Live Nation / Ticketmaster isn&rsquo;t planning to use facial recognition, then why not explicitly commit to that? Even if they only use it in an opt-in manner for entry to events, it still raises significant privacy and civil liberties concerns. And fans will still need to go through a physical search, so it&rsquo;s not really saving anyone any time, it&rsquo;s just an excuse to vacuum up lots of data on music fans. </p><p>If Ticketmaster cares about protecting music fans safety and basic rights, they should make an explicit commitment to not use facial recognition at events, now or in the future. </p><p>Once a private corporation like Ticketmaster has collected hundreds of thousands of people&rsquo;s sensitive biometric information, there&rsquo;s no telling what they could do with it. They could use it to track people around the festival in order to serve them targeted advertising. They could sell that data to other private companies or hand it over to government agencies like ICE or local police. Once biometric data is collected and stored in a database it&rsquo;s vulnerable to attacks, like the Customs and Border Protection facial recognition database that was breached. </p><p>As we&rsquo;ve seen with the airlines, allowing fans to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of facial recognition doesn&rsquo;t fix the problems inherent in the technology. Many fans might not be aware of the risks involved with opting in, and others may feel uncomfortable opting out for fear that it could subject them to additional screening.”</p><p>Live Nation / Ticketmaster’s claims that they have “no current plans” to use this technology are dubious without an explicit commitment. The original <a href="https://www.blinkidentity.com/news/2018/5/22/blink-identity-announces-partnership-with-live-nationticketmaster" target="_blank">announcement</a> from Blink Identity, the facial recognition company they have partnered with, reads “Plans include the use of Blink’s walking-speed biometric solution at venues to facilitate admission to live shows and more.</p><p>At least one sports venue in the UK, which is owned by Live Nation / Ticketmaster, is <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/manchester-city-tries-facial-recognition-to-beat-football-queues-smdrcrkrj?ni-statuscode=acsaz-307" target="_blank">reportedly</a> planning to use facial recognition as well, casting the company’s statement in further doubt.”</p></blockquote><p><b>See the original “Ban Facial Recognition at Festivals” campaign page here: <a href="https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/festivals" target="_blank">https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/festivals</a></b></p><p>Headlining artists like <a href="https://twitter.com/tmorello/status/1171133213403746305" target="_blank">Tom Morello</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/amandapalmer/status/1171100347324162048" target="_blank">Amanda Palmer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/NahkoBear/status/1171154097392635904" target="_blank">Nahko</a> and Medicine for the People, Thievery Corporation, <a href="https://twitter.com/Gramatik/status/1171146242820333569" target="_blank">Gramatik</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/anti_flag/status/1171144484756893701" target="_blank">Anti-Flag</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/atmosphere/status/1171127265628958721" target="_blank">Atmosphere</a>, Speedy Ortiz, The Glitch Mob, <a href="https://twitter.com/DowntownBoys/status/1171098435711307778" target="_blank">Downtown Boys</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/laurastevenson/status/1171120613144047616" target="_blank">Laura Stevenson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thebrianfallon/status/1171155335479996423" target="_blank">Brian Fallon</a> of Gaslight Anthem, and <a href="https://twitter.com/BDolanSFR/status/1171104044867346434" target="_blank">B Dolan</a> support the campaign, and Washington’s USC Events, the producers of Paradiso Festival, are among the first to commit to not use the technology along with <a href="https://twitter.com/PunkRockBowling/status/1171866472861188096" target="_blank">Punk Rock Bowling</a> festival in Las Vegas. </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="497" data-orig-width="603"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/9799d8d312126f84c1967391a8c58813/63959a31c0c495a6-b9/s540x810/698126920890192cce9dd7b0915f431bad15d687.png" data-orig-height="497" data-orig-width="603"/></figure><p><a href="https://mashable.com/2018/05/04/livenation-ticketmaster-facial-recognition/" target="_blank">Ticketmaster</a> and <a href="https://ww2.expologic.com/blog/how-keller-williams-used-face-recognition-to-personalize-streamline-event-check-in" target="_blank">other event companies</a> laud their partnerships in the controversial technology, and even smaller bars and venues are <a href="https://djmag.com/longreads/facial-recognition-technology-coming-club-near-you" target="_blank">experimenting</a> with it.
