See the complete list <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-leads-resolution-to-restore-fccs-net-neutrality-rules" target="_blank">here. </a></i></p><p>Net neutrality advocates have hit an important milestone and are gaining ground in Congress. A Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to overturn the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality has hit the 30 sign-ons from Senators needed to force a vote on the Senate floor. The CRA allows Congress to overturn the FCC’s decision, which has generated widespread bipartisan backlash, with a simple majority vote in the Senate and House, which is increasingly within reach with several Republicans already publicly criticizing the FCC’s move.</p><p><b>Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future (pronouns: she/her), issued the following statement: </b></p><blockquote><p><i>“Internet users are angry, educated, and organized. We refuse to back down. Net neutrality is too important to the future of our democracy. Today’s news shows that lawmakers from both parties cannot hide from their constituents on this issue. Every member of the U.S. Senate will have to go on the record, during a tight election year, and either vote to save the Internet or rubber stamp its death warrant. </i></p><p><i>We will not be fooled by trojan horse legislation branded as a compromise. Millions of people from across the political spectrum fought hard to win the Title II net neutrality protections that the FCC just callously slashed at the behest of telecom lobbyists. The Congressional Review Act gives Congress the power to reverse that corrupt and illegitimate decision and restore the basic protections that enable free expression, creativity, and innovation online. </i></p><p><i>Any lawmaker foolish enough to be on the wrong side of history by voting against the free and open Internet will regret it come election day.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Last week, Fight for the Future announced a no holds barred campaign at <b><a href="http://votefornetneutrality.com" target="_blank">VoteForNetNeutrality.com</a> </b>calling on Internet users to pledge to vote against lawmakers who don’t support the CRA resolution to overturn the FCC decision and restore net neutrality protections. Millions of people have taken action in recent months, bombarding Congress with a flood of phone calls, emails, faxes, tweets, protests, and constituent meetings. </p><p>###</p>
