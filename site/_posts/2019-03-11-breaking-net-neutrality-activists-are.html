Senator Sinema needs to decide right now whether the corporate donations she’s getting from Comcast and AT&amp;T are really worth the cost of being seen as a telecom shill and one of the most corrupt members of her party. We’re crowdfunding this billboard so she knows that there’s nowhere to hide––she can do the right thing or be sure that the entire Internet will know she sold them out.” </p><p>Fight for the Future is pressuring lawmakers from both parties in the House and Senate to cosponsor the Save the Internet Act, which would restore all of the key protections that were repealed by Ajit Pai. They’ve updated the Congressional scoreboard at <b><a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a> </b>and are already driving thousands of emails and calls to lawmakers ahead of a House hearing tomorrow. </p><p>###</p>
