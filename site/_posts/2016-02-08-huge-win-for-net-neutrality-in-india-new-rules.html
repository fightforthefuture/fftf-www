<h2><i>Fight for the Future calls for U.S. to follow suit, ban similarly harmful practices by Comcast,Verizon, T-Mobile, and others</i></h2>
<p>Today, Indian telecom regulator TRAI reaffirmed the principles of net neutrality by <b><a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Big-win-for-net-neutrality-Telecom-regulator-prohibits-discriminatory-tariffs-for-data/articleshow/50901547.cms" target="_blank">banning</a> </b>discriminatory pricing on the basis of content, including so called &ldquo;Zero Rating&rdquo; schemes like Facebook&rsquo;s controversial <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/access-now/open-letter-to-mark-zuckerberg-regarding-internetorg-net-neutrality-privacy-and-/935857379791271/" target="_blank"><b>Free Basics</b></a> program. The decision marks a major victory for <b><a href="https://www.savetheinternet.in/" target="_blank">grassroots activists</a> </b>in India and around the world who have been calling for such a ban, and a setback for companies like T-Mobile and Verizon, who have been pushing similar practices in the U.S., claiming that they do not violate net neutrality.</p>
