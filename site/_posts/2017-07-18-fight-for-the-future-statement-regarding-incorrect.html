<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, July 18, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>This morning Fight for the Future <b><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-07-18-net-neutrality-activists-set-sights-on-congress/" target="_blank">announced</a> </b>plans to put up crowdfunded billboards focused on members of Congress who oppose net neutrality protections.<br/></p><p>Rep Scalise’s name was incorrectly included in private emails to two reporters, due to a copy paste error, and reported by Politico. This error was immediately corrected once brought to our attention, and we regret the confusion it caused. We would obviously not run billboards against someone who is in the hospital, and wish Rep Scalise a speedy recovery.</p><p>As for the billboards focused on other members, Congress plays an important role overseeing the FCC, and voters deserve to know where their members stand. The goal of our billboards is to make sure that the public knows which members are supporting the FCC’s plan to dismantle important net neutrality protections.</p><p>###</p>
