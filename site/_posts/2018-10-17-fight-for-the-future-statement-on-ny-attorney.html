<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: October 16, 2018<br/>Contact: 978-852-6457, press@fightforthefuture.org</p><p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/technology/net-neutrality-inquiry-comments.html" target="_blank"><b>reported</b></a> by several media outlets, the New York Attorney General’s office has expanded its investigation into millions of fraudulent comments that were submitted to the FCC as part of its net neutrality repeal proceeding. As part of the investigation, the AG’s office has issued subpoenas to several net neutrality advocacy groups, including Fight for the Future. </p><p><b>Fight for the Future issued the following statement, which can be attributed to Executive Director Sarah Roth-Gaudette:</b></p><blockquote><p><i>“We welcome this investigation. Fight for the Future was one of the first groups to help uncover the flood of fraudulent comments that were submitted to the FCC, and to call for a thorough investigation. We additionally called for the agency to remove fraudulent comments from the docket regardless of whether they were pro or anti net neutrality, and convened a letter to the FCC from people who were personally affected by this identity theft. </i></p><p><i>Our advocacy tools and campaign pages have helped millions of real people make their voices heard about issues that affect them. But the FCC consistently used the fraudulent comments as a talking point to downplay the overwhelming public opposition to their attack on net neutrality. </i></p><p><i>We hope that this investigation reveals not only who was behind the coordinated submission of fake comments, but whether they collaborated in any way with FCC leadership or telecom companies.”</i></p></blockquote><p>###</p>
