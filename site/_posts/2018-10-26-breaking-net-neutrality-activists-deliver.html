Knight. (Message and data rates apply, reply STOP to opt out.) </p><p>“The public deserves to know whether their elected officials are working for them or working on behalf of their corporate donors,”<b> said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future (pronouns: she/her).</b> “Representative Steve Knight has taken a truckload of money from the telecom industry, and so far he’s sat on his hands while the FCC gutted open Internet protections, allowing ISPs to control what we see and do online with censorship, throttling, and new fees. Representative Knight still has a chance to do the right thing, and based on polls he’d be smart to announce his support for net neutrality ahead of the midterms. The whole Internet is watching.”</p><p>The creative protest is part of a broader campaign to pressure House members to support the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to reverse the FCC’s repeal, which includes net neutrality <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2018-10-25-net-neutrality-advocates-plan-candidate-town-halls/" target="_blank">telephone town halls</a> in two dozen tight race districts, a <a href="http://votefornetneutrality.com" target="_blank">VoteForNetNeutrality.com</a> candidate scorecard, mass text blasts, and online mobilization.</p><p>###</p>
