<h2><i>Actress Michelle Hendley portrays WikilLeaks whistleblower&rsquo;s voice due to prison restrictions barring her from speaking directly to press</i></h2>
<p>WikiLeaks whistleblower Chelsea Manning has released a podcast where she tells her story in her own words. </p>
<p>The recording was produced in collaboration with Amnesty International and voiced by actress Michelle Hendley. Due to prison restrictions, Chelsea is barred from speaking to any members of the press directly, or being recorded during her incarceration, so actress Michelle Hendley (known for her performance in Boy Meets Girl) has lent her voice to Chelsea&rsquo;s words for this episode of Amnesty&rsquo;s series &ldquo;In Their Own Words.&rdquo; </p>
