The announcement comes as Communications and Technology subcommittee members <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-legislating-to-safeguard-the-free-and-open-internet" target="_blank">convene</a> on Capitol Hill to <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-legislating-to-safeguard-the-free-and-open-internet" target="_blank">discuss net neutrality legislation</a>. The activists have given lawmakers until COB March 15th–right before they leave for the March in-district recess–to cosponsor the bill, otherwise groups promise to unleash a flood of calls, emails, and tweets from their district.</p><p>The updated scoreboard shows which members of Congress truly support net neutrality by cosponsoring the Save the Internet Act, and reveals how much they’ve taken in campaign contributions from telecom companies. The scoreboard is a project of BattleForTheNet.com, a net neutrality action site maintained by Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, and Free Press Action Fund. </p><p>Today’s announcement also comes on the heels of a new <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2019-03-11-breaking-net-neutrality-activists-are/" target="_blank">crowdfunding campaign</a> launched by Fight for the Future late last night to put up a billboard in Phoenix targeting Senator Kyrsten Sinema, the only Democratic member of the Senate who has not cosponsored the bill.</p><p>“Enough is enough. There are absolutely no excuses for not supporting this bill,” <b>said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future (pronouns: she/her). </b>“Voters from across the political spectrum are pissed off and have made it very clear that they want strong net neutrality rules back in place as soon as possible. At this point, members of Congress can consider themselves on notice: if you choose to put the telecom giants ahead of your constituents, we will make sure that every single one of your constituents knows you sold them out for cable money. You have until close of business on Friday, March 15th.”</p><p>&ldquo;It is unreal that there is any member of Congress who is still on the wrong side of this issue,&rdquo; <b>said Free Press Action Fund Campaign Director Candace Clement.</b> &ldquo;The Save The Internet Act is exactly the right way to safeguard Net Neutrality. It draws on the overwhelming bipartisan support for real Net Neutrality, including support among vast majorities of Republican, Democratic and independent voters. And it fixes the Trump FCC&rsquo;s massive mistake when it repealed the Open Internet Order in 2017. People, by the millions, protested that FCC decision, and they&rsquo;ve rejected the empty rhetoric and lies of phone- and cable-industry lobbyists. It&rsquo;s time every member of Congress did the same and joined us in support of the Save The Internet Act.”</p><p>“For lawmakers who claim to stand for their constituents and against special interests in Washington, supporting this bill should be one of the easiest things they do this year,” <b>said Mark Stanley, director of communications for Demand Progress.</b> “The Save the Internet Act restores strong net neutrality protections that benefit every person who depends on the open internet to access information, communicate, or run a small business. The tired attacks hurled at this bill and similar measures have proven to be based on industry-backed lies, time and again. Simply put, there’s no excuse — every lawmaker should get behind the Save the Internet Act to restore crucial and commonsense protections for their constituents.”</p><p>###</p>
