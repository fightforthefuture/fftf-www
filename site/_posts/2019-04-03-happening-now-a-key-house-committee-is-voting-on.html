Their main strategy right now is to punch it full of holes with bad amendments. So be sure to tell your rep to vote for a clean bill and oppose amendments that weaken it.</p><p><a href="http://battleforthenet.com/call" target="_blank"><b>Taking action takes just a minute or two and it makes a huge difference.</b></a></p><p>The vote is imminent and we can’t afford to lose this one! If we pass the bill through the committee it will likely get a vote on the House floor next week. But if the bill is gutted through hostile amendments, then we’re back to square one. </p>
