Joe Morelle (D NY-25) <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/1067822802915463168" target="_blank">announced</a> he will sign the CRA resolution discharge petition to overturn the FCC’s net neutrality repeal in a comment to <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wj3gx5/house-democrats-who-havent-supported-net-neutrality-yet-have-all-taken-money-from-telecoms" target="_blank">Motherboard</a> and activists are now pressuring other lawmakers to follow suit. In addition, new sites are joining in to help get the word out, with the wildly popular Urban Dictionary confirming they will run site-wide net neutrality banners during the day of action, and courier delivery app Postmates <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/1067853241831120898" target="_blank">running an in-app ad </a>promoting DeadlineForNetNeutrality.com as part of the final push.</p><h2><i>Major web companies, celebrities, and thousands of Internet users to call on Congress to reverse FCC repeal</i></h2><p>#CyberMonday wasn’t the only major Internet event this week. Internet activists, startups, celebrities, and major web companies are preparing for <b><a href="http://deadlinefornetneutrality.com" target="_blank">DeadlineForNetNeutrality.com</a>, </b>a final Internet-Wide Day of Action this Thursday, November 29th, ahead of the December 10th deadline for the House to act on the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution (H.J.Res. 129) to reverse the FCC’s resoundingly unpopular repeal of net neutrality protections.</p><p>The effort is <a href="http://donatefornetneutrality.com" target="_blank">backed by</a> musicians and celebrities like Hollywood star <b>Evangeline Lilly </b>(Ant-Man and the Wasp, The Hobbit, Lost), Rage Against the Machine guitarist <b>Tom Morello</b>, and EDM star <b>Bassnectar,</b> along with startups and major web companies like online selling platform <b>Etsy,</b> delivery service <b>Postmates</b>, publishing platform<b> Tumblr</b>, <b>Private Internet Access</b> VPN, popular blog <b>BoingBoing</b>, domain registrar <b>Namecheap,</b> search engine <b>StartPage</b>, and speaker company <b>Sonos. </b></p><p>On Thursday thousands of Internet users will sign an open letter to Congress containing a heartfelt plea to overturn the FCC’s repeal. Then users will be asked to submit an &ldquo;I support net neutrality&rdquo; photo to show House reps the human face of net neutrality supporters. Over 2000 photos have already submitted and activists have pledged to flood lawmakers’ social media feeds with photos between now and the deadline. While the open letter is addressed to all of Congress, Fight for the Future will be putting additional pressure on the handful of <b><a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/1064978884704256001" target="_blank">remaining Democrats</a> </b>who have yet to support the CRA despite the party’s repeated promise to help restore net neutrality.</p><p>“These folks are taking on the telecom lobby machine and fighting for a free, open, and uncensored Internet,” <b>said Tom Morello,</b> “Net neutrality is the free speech fight of this generation and time is running out. It’s time for the Internet to rise up again.”</p><p>“This is not a partisan issue, the battle for the net is a fight for our most basic freedoms. People from across the entire political spectrum can agree that we don’t want anyone to control or manipulate what we see and do on the Internet,”<b> added actress Evangeline Lilly.</b></p><p>“Net neutrality is not dead yet. Not even close,” <b>said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future (pronouns: she/her),</b> “But as the clock runs out for this Congress to act, we have an opportunity to show the entire world which elected officials are willing to fight for net neutrality, and which ones decide to sit on their hands and let big telecom companies take control over what we can see and do on the Internet.”</p><p>###</p>
