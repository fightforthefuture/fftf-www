Her name appears next to Rep Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA), who has now officially signed on to the discharge petition <a href="https://gizmodo.com/democrat-signs-house-petition-to-save-net-neutrality-af-1831083087" target="_blank"><b>after facing</b></a> a flurry of angry phone calls and messages from constituents when she put out a video last week saying she wouldn’t sign.</p><p>Internet activist group Fight for the Future has been using the page <b><a href="http://demsagainstthe.net" target="_blank">DemsAgainstThe.Net</a> </b>to highlight the handful of remaining Democrats who are the only members of their party who have not signed on to the CRA. And online actions surrounding the open letter at<b> <a href="http://DeadlineForNetNeutrality.com" target="_blank">DeadlineForNetNeutrality.com</a></b> have been amplified by celebrities like Tom Morello, Evangeline Lilly, and Bassnectar, along with companies like Tumblr, Etsy, Postmates, and Reddit. The group also <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2018-12-14-today-in-dc-activists-launch-mobile-billboard/" target="_blank"><b>deployed a mobile billboard </b></a>in Washington, DC that cycled through the faces of every member of Congress who has not signed the CRA. </p><p>“The fight for net neutrality is far from over, but time is running out for members of Congress to make decision: do they want to go down in history as the corrupt politicians who rubber stamped the repeal of net neutrality? Or will they sign on to the CRA discharge petition and show that they’re willing to put their constituents’ basic rights ahead of their corporate donors,” <b>said Evan Greer, Deputy Director of Fight for the Future (pronouns: she/her).</b></p><p>Last week, on the one year anniversary of the FCC repeal, the group<b> <a href="https://medium.com/@fightfortheftr/no-net-neutrality-is-not-dead-heres-where-we-re-at-and-what-comes-next-aff2212d6fc7?fbclid=IwAR2q7cM_391wE_7HsRvehM5yoZU4dH3IQwjexllrcITKsHa3dkWahWAUPoE" target="_blank">issued a blog post</a></b> explaining the path ahead for net neutrality beyond the CRA resolution. Fight for the Future will continue to push in Congress, in the states, and in the courts, until net neutrality is restored.</p><p>###</p>
