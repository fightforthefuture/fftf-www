The actions of this committee today are an attack not just on net neutrality, but on our democracy.” </p><p>These Assembly members voted to gut the bill: Santiago, Garcia, Low, Quirk-Silva, Cervantes, Rodrigues, Maienschein, Kamlager-Dove</p><p>These voted against: Obernolte, Mathis</p><p><b>Despite thousands of phone calls from constituents, and <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Nancy-Pelosi-intervenes-in-California-net-13008641.php" target="_blank">letters from</a> Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep Anna Eshoo, Chairman Santiago’s amendments to SB 822 will leave the bill gutted and:</b></p><p>* Allow ISPs to charge websites and small businesses “access fees” just to reach their customers, and block any website or service that doesn’t pay the fee.</p><p>* Allows ISPs to circumvent net neutrality protections at the point where data enters the network. Thus, instead of blocking a website as it is transported over the ISP’s network, the ISP can just block it as it enters the ISP’s network</p><p>* Allows ISPs to throttle entire classes of applications, (e.g. all online gaming or all online voice calls). Remember that AT&amp;T was previously busted blocking iMessage</p><p>* Allows ISPs to Zero-rate their own content, ie AT&amp;T can incentivize you to watch CNN, which they now own, or Comcast can make it free for you to go to NBC’s website while making you use your data to get your news elsewhere.</p><p>* Allows ISPs to charge services fees in exchange for zero-rating them, giving large corporations a huge unfair advantage over startups and small businesses.</p><p>###</p>
