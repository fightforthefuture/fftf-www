Now it’s time to channel that outrage into action. Put simply, the Save the Internet Act is the only real net neutrality bill out there. This is a simple up or down vote on the future of the Internet and our most basic rights in the digital age. Lawmakers have nowhere to hide. From now until the bill hits the floor for a vote, we will organize Internet users en masse to demand that every single member of Congress to co-sponsor this legislation and will update our congressional “scoreboard” so people know whether their elected officials are representing them or shilling for cable and phone companies.</p><p>Telecom lobbyists and their friends in Congress seem to think that Internet users are incredibly gullible. They’ve introduced three separate pieces of “trojan horse” legislation in a cynical attempt to muddy the waters and confuse the public. But we won’t be fooled, and neither will the hundreds of millions of people who we’ve mobilized to fight for real net neutrality.</p><p>The Save the Internet Act is one of the few pieces of Congressional legislation that actually does what it says in the title. The Internet is going to come down like a political hammer on any lawmaker who fails to cosponsor it.”<br/></p>
