The billboards send a strong message to any Members of Congress contemplating support for the FCC’s plan to repeal net neutrality, which is currently being tracked through a <b>“<a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/#scoreboard" target="_blank">congressional scorecard</a></b>” on BattleForTheNet.com. So far very few lawmakers have been willing to publicly support Ajit Pai’s plan, likely in light of polling that shows voters &ndash; including Republicans &ndash; overwhelmingly oppose it.</p><figure data-orig-width="3073" data-orig-height="1417" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/43709916731ba6fa49023c4087876433/tumblr_inline_ouq6amcwc61ri3xd7_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="3073" data-orig-height="1417"/></figure><p>The billboards encourage constituents to contact their elected representatives; for example, Speaker Paul Ryan’s billboard in Janesville, WI asks, “Want slower, more expensive Internet? Rep. Paul Ryan supports Charter’s plan to destroy net neutrality. Ask him why: (608) 752-4050.”</p><p>The outdoor ads feature some of the few members of Congress who came out with early support for FCC’s plan to repeal net neutrality rules, including:</p><ul><li>Clarksville, TN – Rep.
