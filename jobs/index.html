<h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>

<p>Fight for the Future is a non-profit organization whose mission is to ensure that the web continues to hold freedom of expression and creativity at its core. We primarily work on high value, fearless projects that can be seen by millions. We’re a very small team, but we’re always looking for new people with brilliant ideas. Fight for the Future is 100% remote and timezone flexible. Please see below for our current job openings.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="front-end-software-engineer">Front-End Software Engineer</h1>

<h2 id="a-ux-expert-and-engineer-for-defending-the-internet">(A UX expert and engineer, for defending the Internet)</h2>

<h2 id="about-the-role">ABOUT THE ROLE</h2>

<p>Fight for the Future is looking for a software engineer to lead the front-end development side of our digital campaigning efforts. This is more than a simple coding or campaigning position. This is a leadership position for someone who understands the threats that face the future of free expression on the Internet, and who can creatively use the Internet as a medium for political change.</p>

<h2 id="about-you">ABOUT YOU</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You’re an excellent front-end coder who can make things work and work well for millions of users.</li>
  <li>You can faithfully implement others’ designs and make good decisions about layout, typography, and color when needed (but you definitely don’t need to be an expert designer or have illustration skills!)</li>
  <li>You can build high quality user interaction with intuitive prompts, modals, clear buttons, etc, spotting and fixing UI problems as you go.</li>
  <li>You could design straight to code if needed, and while your own design choices don’t have to look fancy or highly polished (authentic is often better!) the result should be crafted, professional and ready to put in front of millions of people.</li>
  <li>You are familiar with current product innovations, messaging apps, social media, UI/UX, and design.</li>
  <li>You understand rapid prototyping and release, user adoption, and A/B testing, and you can navigate cost/benefits analysis of various technical solutions, languages, and architecture-based decisions.</li>
  <li>You can think on your feet, be organized, optimize project plans and workload, and manage/delegate the different pieces of projects.</li>
  <li>You enjoy a fast-paced environment and can pivot quickly as needed to make changes based on changing outside requirements.</li>
  <li>You like brainstorming ways to simplify the scope of a project to fit a given timeline (e.g. if the team asks for something crazy/hard, maybe there’s a much easier way to achieve a similar result) and you’re always looking for those kinds of lovely simplifications.</li>
  <li>You’re happy doing some self-QA and tweaking until a user experience works reliably and feels nice.</li>
  <li>You’re good at thinking into and around a problem, exposing corner cases and potential issues to non-technical collaborators.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-youll-be-building">WHAT YOU'LL BE BUILDING:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Flawless HTML/CSS paired with clear, modern design, and intuitive UX to send powerful messages out into the world &amp; apply political pressure in the right places at the right time.</li>
  <li>Modern JavaScript (ES6), build tools (Babel, Gulp, Grunt), and possibly a framework-driven interactive site (React, Angular). These tools are changing rapidly, so learning on the job is encouraged.</li>
  <li>Solutions that achieve our goals by leveraging and customizing existing services (CRM, publishing tools, etc).</li>
  <li>Innovative or unconventional tools to effectively mobilize a large audience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="things-that-you-might-like-about-this-job">THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE ABOUT THIS JOB:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It’s telecommute work with a 100% remote team.</li>
  <li>We do retreats and in-person sprints too, because it’s nice to see people!</li>
  <li>The work will be highly varied, like freelancing on a variety of projects.</li>
  <li>You can choose the framework and tools we use to get stuff done, and use whatever you’re most excited about.</li>
  <li>Be a hero to many. The “yeah, I made that” small talk in bars is fun.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requirements">REQUIREMENTS:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Experience writing modern HTML/CSS with responsive design techniques and awareness of common cross-browser problems.</li>
  <li>An understanding of client-side JavaScript - AJAX, handling events, DOM manipulation and cross-browser compatibility.</li>
  <li>Knowledge of progressive enhancement strategies and ability to create simple sites that can function with JavaScript disabled or seamlessly integrate subtle CSS transitions for a refined user experience.</li>
  <li>Proven ability to do clean and classy design when needed.</li>
  <li>Ability to make good UI/UX decisions and spot problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bonus-points-for">BONUS POINTS FOR:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Familiarity with static site generators - many of our campaign microsites are built on Jekyll.</li>
  <li>Experience writing modern JavaScript (ES6) and using build tools like Babel, Gulp or Grunt. These tools are changing rapidly, so again, learning on the job is encouraged.</li>
  <li>Experience building front-end applications with a modern framework like React or Angular.</li>
  <li>Having successfully launched a great product working in a small team</li>
  <li>Ability to build and manage teams</li>
  <li>Strong participation in communities like Reddit or HN</li>
  <li>Lots of remote / freelance experience solving problems on tight deadlines</li>
  <li>Persuasive writing skills for an online audience</li>
  <li>Experience working remotely (we use slack/trello/google hangouts)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mega-bonus-points-for">MEGA BONUS POINTS FOR:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Having built and marketed your own product.</li>
  <li>Having been a leader—of anything—especially online, especially tech-related</li>
  <li>Experience with activism, resistance, creative and positive troublemaking, or any kind of fiery provocative work in any area.</li>
</ul>

<p>To apply, fill out the application <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2SYlDGFnDblUmqBh6qpyVnaSH-6F80B8DroMEUkFU3fuDtg/viewform">here</a>.

<h1 id="campaign-strategist--manager">Campaign Strategist / Manager</h1>

<p>Our organization is focused on developing high-impact campaigns that resonate with people and help them band together to exert their power. The Campaign Manager/ Manager position is one of the most important roles in our work - it is central to the organization and its effectiveness. If you ever wanted to build online experiences that reach out, grab people, and help them change the world, then this is the job for you. We’re looking for someone to continue to build that organization with us, from the ground up.</p>

<p>We’re looking for someone smart and savvy and who can be funny and playful with ideas; we’re looking for someone who can speak to people’s humor, fears and what gets them going; and we want someone who has purposeful humor and creativity as well as poignant ideas and language that can cut through political gridlock and debate.</p>

<p>We look for people with a rigorous and thought-provoking perspective on a wide range of political issues, and especially on tech and policy. We want you to be a thinker and someone who can synthesize a problem or an idea out of ordinary interaction and frustrations / struggles.</p>

<p>You should be able to think on your feet, be organized, optimize organizational and project plans and work load, manage/delegate the different pieces of a campaign (outreach, press, writing, product) and set up the organization for long term growth. You will also interface with others, so to some extent you should have smart, powerful ideas to share with others. You should understand and be able to express in ways that resonate with your audience the nuances and overarching themes of tech policy, free internet principles, and organizing on the ground and online.</p>

<p>We’d especially enjoy someone who has a wide interest in pulling off tactics and strategy and using whatever resources are at their disposal—you should have an interest in using law, policies, pop culture, music, philosophy, subcultural themes, memes, language, history, media, organizing playbooks, and whatever else is out there to pull off a really hard-hitting and exciting campaign for the right audience.</p>

<p>We’re hiring for senior to mid-level campaigners who have experience with digital or traditional organizing but generally want to innovate to win.</p>

<p>We have several positions, so if you have skills and expertise with just one aspect of campaigning but truly excel at it—from digital growth to on the ground activism—we want to hear from you.</p>

<h2 id="desired-skills--experience">Desired Skills &amp; Experience</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Writing for a large audience</li>
  <li>Running campaigns on high-impact issues</li>
  <li>Managing campaigns and responses to a fast-changing, dynamic field</li>
  <li>Working with a large variety of people, groups, and companies and spreading the message to as many stakeholders as possible</li>
  <li>Fighting against money in politics and heavily-funded lobbying teams</li>
  <li>Playing a key role in the planning and strategy of campaign organizing and organization growth</li>
  <li>Leading or starting a coalition</li>
  <li>Finding and securing new sources for campaigns</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="you-should-also-have-experience">You should also have experience</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Running online campaigns that grow fast</li>
  <li>Crafting exciting and persuasive actions</li>
  <li>Using online and traditional media to achieve broad visibility (including by talking with press)</li>
  <li>Fighting hard for something</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="compensation">Compensation</h2>

<p>Market Rate / Commensurate with Experience
Full health and dental benefits
Office support</p>

<h2 id="location">Location</h2>

<p>The team will be 100% remote-no need to commute or relocate. If you’re interested in relocation, let us know. We’d start working with you on a contract basis at an hourly rate, but we will be able to offer full-time position with competitive salary and benefits to the right person.</p>

<h2 id="to-apply">To apply</h2>

<p>To apply, fill out the application <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2SYlDGFnDblUmqBh6qpyVnaSH-6F80B8DroMEUkFU3fuDtg/viewform">here</a>. Show us that you excel at the things we’re looking for. If you like, include links to or samples of your writing—ideally in situations where you’re writing to persuade a group of people too. Include as much relevant information as possible: significant things you’ve done, projects you’ve worked on, etc. Being well-rounded is a plus, so don’t exclude significant skills or achievements just because they aren’t activism related (e.g. starting a business, or being a musician).</p>
